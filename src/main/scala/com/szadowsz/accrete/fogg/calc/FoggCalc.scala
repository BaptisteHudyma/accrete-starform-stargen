   * Method to procedurally generate the mass of a star in solar mass.
   *
   * The solar mass is a standard unit of mass in astronomy that is used to indicate the masses of
   * other stars, as well as clusters, nebulae and galaxies. It is equal to the mass of the Sun, about two
   * nonillion kilograms. As per section "2. The Microcomputer Model" in Extra-solar Planetary Systems: A Microcomputer
   * Simulation, we are aiming for a star of a mass between 0.6 and 1.3 solar masses.

   * Method to approximate the luminosity of a star for a given mass. This function comes from the section
   * "3. Characteristics of The Primary Star" in Extra-solar Planetary Systems: A Microcomputer Simulation.
   *
   * @note The solar luminosity, is a unit of radiant flux (power emitted in the form of photons)
   *       conventionally used by astronomers to measure the luminosity of stars. One solar luminosity is equal to
   *       the current accepted luminosity of the Sun, which is 3.839×1026 W, or 3.839×1033 erg/s. The value is
   *       slightly higher, 3.939×1026 W (equivalent to 4.382×109 kg/s or 1.9×10?16 M?/d) if the solar
   *       neutrino radiation is included as well as electromagnetic radiation. The Sun is a weakly variable star
   *       and its luminosity therefore fluctuates.[4] The major fluctuation is the eleven-year solar cycle
   *       (sunspot cycle), which causes a periodic variation of about ±0.1%. Any other variation over the last
   *       200–300 years is thought to be much smaller than this.
