    * Method to approximate the luminosity of a star for a given mass. See eq. 1-3 in section "3. Characteristics of The Primary Star" in Extra-solar Planetary
    * Systems: A Microcomputer Simulation.
    *
    * @note The solar luminosity, is a unit of radiant flux (power emitted in the form of photons) conventionally used by astronomers to measure the luminosity
    *       of stars. One solar luminosity is equal to the current accepted luminosity of the Sun, which is 3.839×1026 W, or 3.839×1033 erg/s. The value is
    *       slightly higher, 3.939×1026 W (equivalent to 4.382×109 kg/s or 1.9×10?16 M?/d) if the solar neutrino radiation is included as well as
    *       electromagnetic radiation. The Sun is a weakly variable star and its luminosity therefore fluctuates. The major fluctuation is the eleven-year
    *       solar cycle (sunspot cycle), which causes a periodic variation of about ±0.1%. Any other variation over the last 200–300 years is thought to be
    *       much smaller than this.
