## Implementations

###[ACRETE](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2649232823724285381&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5)

- Author: Stephen H. Dole
- Language: Most likely FORTRAN due to it being written for a IBM 7044.
- Year: 1969

Stephen H. Dole wrote the original program and research paper that detailed the solar system formation simulation code. He was a prolific astronomy 
researcher and whilst I have not recovered his original source code; I have a reliable recreation of his original engine based on his papers that exist online, 
with the exception of the random number generator that he used.

###[ACRETE](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.arts.sf.science/2Xm6WP5n1F8))

- Author: Steve Gilham
- Language: Basic
- Year: 1984

Steve wrote a variant based on Dole's original paper in Icarus in the late '60s. It appeared in the gaming magazine White Dwarf issue 57 which was published 
around 1984. He may have also released it on usenet, but such a post is missing from google groups.


###[Silicon Creation](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9385174980475541539&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5)

- Author: Martyn J. Fogg
- Language: BBC Basic
- Year: 1985

Martyn J. Fogg wrote a subsequent research paper that attempted to vary the mass of the star and build up information about the potential atmosphere of each 
planet in the generated system. Brian Davis reports that he wrote Fogg to request the source, and he replied that is was on a discarded machine in his 
garage, and even he wouldn't retrieve it, but write it from scratch again if the situation ever came up.

###[ACCRETE 1a/1b](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9385174980475541539&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5)

- Author: Dave Allen
- Language: IBM Basic
- Year: 1988

Dave Allen claims in usml to have written variations of Accrete, 1a to allow captured moons rather than coalesce straight away. The second one, 1b, an attempt
to simulate moon systems, as well as potentially an original version. I cannot currently find any source code of these programs online so his branches are
considered to end with him and its hard to see how they fit into the big picture.

###[Accrete](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.arts.sf.science/2Xm6WP5n1F8)

- Author: Matt Burdick / Steve Gilham
- Language: C
- Year: 1988

A version of Matt Burdick's code, ported to C from pascal. Was posted to a usernet newsgroup by Steve Gilham. Whilst it does seem to date back to 1988, his 
posts were cut off, so the code is incomplete.

###[SYSTEM 2300](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.games.frp/uRaCg-xv6Ac)

- Author: Burton Choinski
- Language: C
- Year: 1990

Burton wrote a variation on burdick's accrete/starform program for the 2300ad RPG. It uses a combination of the World Builder's Guid, the Director's guide 
and accrete. I cannot currently find any source code of this program online, so this branch is considered orphaned right now, since I don't know where it 
fits into the bigger picture.


###[ACRETE](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sci.astro/9WzlczI3cL0)

- Author: Wales Larrison
- Language: C ?
- Year: <= 1992 ?

Jon Leech claims that Wales wrote a variation based on Dole's 1970 paper. I cannot currently find any source code of this program online, so this branch is 
considered orphaned right now, since I don't know where it fits into the bigger picture.

###[ACRETE](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sci.astro/9WzlczI3cL0)

- Author: Jon Leech
- Language: C++
- Year: <= 1992

Jon Leech ported code to C++ based on code written by Wales Larrison. He mentions an ftp site where his code is located, though I have acquired some version 
of it from Ian Burrel's website.

###[Starform](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.games.design/xp8edV1wyIE)

- Author: Matt Burdick / Sean Malloy 
- Language: C
- Year: <= 1993

More up-to-date version of Matt Burdick's code, ported to C from pascal. Was given to Ian Burrell by Sean Malloy. Seems to be more feature complete than the 
one uploaded by Steve Gilham.

###[ACRETE](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.arts.sf.science/2Xm6WP5n1F8)

- Author: Steve Gilham
- Language: C++
- Year: 1995

Steve wrote a port of his original basic code to c++.

###[Accrete](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.arts.sf.science/MqgYTuIf13w)

- Author: Erik Max Francis
- Language: C
- Year: 1996

Erik Max Francis produced a slightly modified version of Burdick's code that prints it's output slightly differently.
