TITLE: Looking for software derived from ACCRETE 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Friday, 1 March 1996 08:00:00 UTC - Joel Hunter Crook:
I'm looking for programs which are derived from ACCRETE. ACCRETE was a planetary
system accretion simulation program developed at RAND Corp. during the late '60s
by Stephen Dole. 
I recently discovered a web address which has pascal and c variations of ACCRETE
but with modifications based on a paper by M. Fogg wrote and published in ICARUS
in 1989. Unfortunately I don't quite understand the reasons for the changes. The
source code I have has annotations but no explanations.
        Does anybody here know if Fogg's program / source code is available? Are there
any other similar programs / source code available?
Thanks,

Joel Hunter Crook

I would like to add my second to this, especially a Macintosh form. I've
got code, but while I'm trying to port it, I really am not nearly far
enough along in programming knowledge to do this.
