TITLE: The old Accrete Program (software) 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Monday, 15 April 1996 08:00:00 UTC+1 - Das Miller:
I recently got hold of the source code for Accrete (it supposedly makes a
realistic-looking list of planets for a solar system).  I've updated some
of the syntax and converted it into a Windows program so it's more
pleasant to work with.  I'm thinking about jazzing it up some (minimal
graphics, a few user options, maybe teach it some new tricks) and
releasing it as freeware but before I do:  
   Do the real astronomers & astrophysicists consider the Accrete
algorithm to be interesting or stupid? 
   Is there a more-respected algorithm out there?
   Did someone already *do* this stuff?
   Any feature requests?

Can you say more about the "Accrete algorithm"? What is the physics
involved? What does the user input?

More specifically, I would want to know:

- Has the interstellar cloud already collapsed?

- Does this program treat the accretion disk as a fluid?

- What equations are used?
(There should be ones for momentum, conservation of energy, conservation
of mass)

- What is the geometry of the disk (axially symmetric? etc.) ?

- How do you specify the clumps (planets)? 

- How is the central star (proto-star) treated? (A protostar,
say in T-Tauri phase, or something else?)

- How does the gas in the disk escape? (stellar winds?)

- How are the gas giant formed formed? How are the terrestrial planets
formed?

To be taken seriously, or thought of as "realistic," I would want some
majority of these elements in the program.

Well, right now, there's NO user input - it randomly assigns a few
parameters.  That's the first thing I'd like to change.


>More specifically, I would want to know:
<big snip of things that I don't have specific answers for, unfortunately>
I've got the source code, but I don't have an explanation of the
algorithm.  According to the comments in the code, it's from "Formation of
Planetary Systems by Aggregation:  a Computer Simulation" by Stephen H.
Dole,  October 1969, 'Rand Corporation Paper'

Without trying wade through the algorithm, it *does* seem to be based on
the collapse of a big cloud of dust (the word "Dust" occurs in the source
code a LOT) into fewer, larger planetesimals.  If I'm able to puzzle out
answers to some of your more specific questions, I'll do a follow-up post.

I'm certainly willing to settle for 'realistic' 

Thanks for responding

Stephen Dole wrote a book called "Habitable Planets For Man" back in the
70's. He also published at least one article in Icarus about software
simulation of planetary formation. Followup articles expanded on the
program (which I think WAS also called Accrete), with authors like Sagan
and Kaula. If you have a well stocked University library nearby, you may
be able to find the original articles.

Martyn Fogg also expanded on the code in a series of articles in The
Journal of the British Interplanetary Society (JBIS)

.

I'm willing to settle for better than a WAG.

I would like the source code for that program.  Would you be willing to 
give it to me.

Here are two Web pages with the source code and executables:

An excellent Web page:

http://www.clark.net/pub/nyrath/starmap.html <http://www.clark.net/pub/nyrath/starmap.html>

The Accrete Home Page:

http://www-leland.stanford.edu/~iburrell/create/accrete.html <http://www-leland.stanford.edu/~iburrell/create/accrete.html>

BTW - Here's a great learning opportunity; instead of asking, waiting  -
and depending on - other people's kindness in supplying you software and
information,  Visit Alta Vista (http://altavista.digital.com/ <http://altavista.digital.com/>) and learn
how to use it. It took me *less than 30 seconds* to find the above sites.
My search string was very simple: "accrete" AND "source code". You never
know what you'll find when you look for things on your own...
