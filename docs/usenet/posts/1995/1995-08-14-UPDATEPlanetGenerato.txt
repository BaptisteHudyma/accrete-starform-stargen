TITLE: UPDATE: Planet Generators 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Monday, 14 August 1995 08:00:00 UTC+1 - Steve Dang:
Ok, here's what I've found so far:
- ftp.uu.net <http://ftp.uu.net> /comp.sources.misc/volume10/tec
        This package contains source code for David Allen's Continental Drift
Simulator.  Includes ports to: Sun, Unix, Amiga, PC.  I tested the PC
version (Turbo C), and it compiles/works fine.

- ftp.uu.net <http://ftp.uu.net> /comp.sources.misc/volume18/planet
        This package is an update to the above.  Now includes Clim, a climate
generator, and Globe, an X program to animate the maps.  Also includes
an update to Tec.  However, this doesn't compile on PC's.

- ftp.clark.net <http://ftp.clark.net> /packages/universe/old/starform.src
        This was posted to the now defunct(?) Universe Simulator Mailing List.
NOTE: this file is no longer there.  My archie search found this, but
I guess the catalog(?) it used is outdated.  However, I'm in the
process of getting this from someone who has it.

- http://www.fourmilab.ch/terranova <http://www.fourmilab.ch/terranova>
        Every day, a new planet is generated, and you can view it here.  The
source for this is available (UNIX).  There should be a link for this
in the author's (John Walker) home page -- it's called ppmforge.


I'm sure there are plenty other (re)sources out there on this subject.
Care to add to it?

I'm hesitant to add all of this stuff to my home page, since my
provider will start charging me after so many megs have been accessed
through my home page.  We'll see...


Enjoy
