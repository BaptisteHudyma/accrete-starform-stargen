Actually, if you wanted very realistic solar systems, the tables
provided in Other Suns are very good and my computerized generation
program is based on them.

Well, let's have a look at my config...

datafile = ~/World_Builder_s_Handbook.supp
variant = yes
personal_input = yes

Whilch means that I use Megatraveller and the WBH as a basis, and then do what
I want with the results. So there IS a god, but no one can be sure... :-)

Personally i use a giant ball of plasma, using a simple hydrogen fusion system 
and a stellar cascade of matter being thrown out from it, with the lighter 
elements more plentyful on the outer planets/asteroids.
=)
Sun
Hot heavy planets
Earth likes
asteroid belts around here
Gas Giants
more asteroid belts here
small light cold worlds
  
And Moons aplenty.(GM call)
Depending on the star, you alter the number of each type of planet (D4-1 is ok)
  
  Quick and simple.
Then use a GM call to alter the worlds at will (for the earth likes, any tables
for PC homeworlds works ok)

This works quick and easy, with minimum tables and rolling.
Then the Jokers come along and set up the Chain Stars and really confuse the 
PC's <grin>

Hum. Where'd you learn to make star systems?  I start with a cloud of
highly dispersed cloud of matter (a nebula) and then start condensing it
into a disk.  For a more detailed explaination, see a modern astronomy
book.

Me, I use a combination of GURPS Space, plus some additional data from 2300AD,
plus some formulae I've cooked up on my own based on a few undergrad physics
courses.  That's for when I want really detailed systems, and since I do'em
by hand this is really only good for a few systems at a time; when I have to
write up a large amount of systems I do a much more cursory treatment 
(basically just deciding whether there's anything very interesting there, such
as habitable worlds and suchlike; I can always make up more details later if
I need them).

Speaking of Amiga programs (as the guy who started this thread did), in
addition, you might also try World Construction Set.  It doesn't create
solar systems, though.  It creates PLANETS!  It lets you realistically
landscape a whole planet, oceans, continents and all.  You can zoom in
and have complete cities!  Focus on a particular building, even.  You
also add trees and vegetation, and frost, and such.

It doesn't actually create ecosystems, it just creates the "look" of the
planet.  You CAN however show your players a picture, or an animation, and
say, "This is the planet Floogg-hharnneem!"  :-)

I've been meaning to get my hands on this program (it's shareware, BTW,
or maybe it's licenseware...) but don't have the capacity at the moment,
and am a little short on funds...  :-/

The price is US$199.

If there are any programs for this kind of thing floating around out
there, could someone please post them or their locations? Thanks!

    The program I use when in a hurry is SSG (Solar System Generator).  
It runs on the Amiga and can be found in most, if not all, of the 
archives.  Look in the game/role or game/misc directories for SSGv11.lha
(I think I got the version number right...)
    The program uses the GURPS space method of generating solar system 
and the documentation is almost toally nil.  The generation is 
_completely_ random, so expect a hell of a lot of systems with no 
naturally habatable planets at all.  (Oh, and a lot of moons too.... :)

Non Servium,
   Doug.

P.S - I think it comes with the C source code as well.

Actually, it DOES let you create the EFFECTS of an ecosystem (i.e. trees
and other vegetation, snow, rivers, etc.) but it's all a matter of, "ok,
I want some trees over there, and some snowcaps over here...."  I don't
think they've implemented clouds yet, but they're working on it.

Course, what I'D eventually like to get my hands on is a program that will
let me plug in the parameters for an environment, and have it simulate the
way the planet would work, something where I could say, "Ok, I want a planet
with this proportion of water in the atmosphere, with this thickness of the
atmosphere, with this landmass-to-ocean ratio, and this distance from a
G-class star..." and have it tell me exactly what kind of weather I'd get
there, and then let me tinker with the model until the environment there
was like I wanted.

But that's beyond this discussion, anyway...  :-)

Actually, it's probably beyond the ability of todays home computers, too.

So far as I know, only an Amiga version exists.  However, if there WAS a
PC version, it would probably cost a bunch more, simply because PC users,
by definition, tend to tolerate insane prices for their software.

(Ducking!)

Mind you, you should be able to get an Amiga for a reasonable price, used.
I'd recommend one of the more recent models, though, like a 1200 or a 4000,
because they have better graphics than the older models.  Or you can get a
2000 or 3000 and plug in a 24bit card like the Toccata.

For further details, I'd go to comp.sys.amiga.* and ask around, especially
on the .marketplace sub.

Mind you, some programs which originated on the Amiga have migrated to the
PC, Distant Suns, for instance, or VistaPro, so it IS possible that World
Construction Set might eventually migrate, too.

Time will tell.

We now return you to our regularly scheduled newsgroup.  :-)
