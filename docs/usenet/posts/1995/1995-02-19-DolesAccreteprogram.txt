TITLE: Dole's "Accrete" program 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sunday, 19 February 1995 23:51:31 UTC - Soenke Behrens:
Hi,
some of you may remember S. Dole's program "Accrete", which simulated 
formation of a solar system by accretion, written in 1969. Though extremely 
simple, it still yielded amazingly accurate results (or so the article I 
read says).

What I am after is an incarnation of this program, preferably the original 
Pascal source. Or Dole's contact address. Or anything, really. It sounds 
nifty, but where would one find it?

Thanks a lot

Soenke

If so, please send any bug reports (code changes are even better) to
me (bur...@openmail.corp.hp.com <>) and I'll fix up my version.  I think
any weird results are probably the outcome of some twiddling when I
was trying to generalize the solar system accretion.  I was hoping to
apply it recursively to produce moons for each of the planets.  I did
have some luck, but the outcome is very dependent on what parameters
you choose for the initial dust and gas cloud density.  Does your
version have the -m (generate moons) option?

I tried responding to this thread before, but it doesn't seem like my
reply made it out.  I hope this one does.

If anyone is interested, I can make my original Pascal and more recent
C source briefly available for ftp.  I can't leave the stuff on the
server long, but let me know if you can't use ftp.
