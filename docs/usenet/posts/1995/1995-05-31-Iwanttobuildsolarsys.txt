TITLE: I want to build solar systems at home!

Wednesday, 31 May 1995 08:00:00 UTC+1 - Dave Hardenbrook:
In "Cosmos", Carl Sagan talks about and shows sample
output of a program called ACRETE which simulates the
growth and accretion of planetesimals in the solar nebula
and generates hypothetical planetary systems.  The program
is described in much greater detail by Sagan and
Richard Isaacman of Cornell University in an article
which appeared in volume 31, page 510-533 of the planetary
Journal ICARUS in 1977.  For my personal enlightenment,
I have tried to reconstruct the program from this article
but I'm afraid that I just don't have the necessary
physics background.  Does anyone know where I can possibly
obtain the source code (preferably in C or C++) or the
executable (preferably for the Amiga) of this program
or another like it that generates scientifically
plausible hypothetical solar systems?

There was a thread on this topic in March which included a C++
program from Steve Gilham ( st...@windsong.demon.co.uk <> ). Not
having a C compiler I tried the BASIC program he supplied which
worked fine.

You should be able to find it lying around on an ftp site somewhere; do
an archie search for it and you should be able to come up with something.
If you can't, email me, and I'll send the source to you (it's in C).

To get an idea of what the program comes up with, here's the sample
output of a given run of the star and the first three inner planets;
the particular run showed here had a total of twelve planets.

(I've modified the form of the output slightly from the original program
to be a little more consistent, but the information displayed is
unmodified).

This may be because the original progam had a Fortrannish 6-character
name, ACRETE.  I have C source of a version that's been floating around
the 'net for a while, which is large and fancy, but allegedly buggy;
and two versions C++ & BASIC of a simpler, cruder implementation of
Dole's accretion kernel of my own devising.
