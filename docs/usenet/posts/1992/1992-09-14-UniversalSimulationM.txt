TITLE: Universal Simulation Mailing List FTP site 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Monday, 14 September 1992 20:55:35 UTC+1 - Eric Chris Garrison:
I found the following on the FTP site list.  It says it is defunct,
and I *really* would like to get ahold of all of the files listed
for that FTP site.  Is there a way to get it (is there another site,
does anyone who got stuff from there still have some of the stuff)???
Any information/leads would be greatly appreciated.

thanks,

Eric


Name:           Universal Simulation Mailing List (usml) ftp site
Address:        topgun.agps.lanl.gov <http://topgun.agps.lanl.gov> (192.12.184.4)
Status:         Apparently Defunct
Info Updated:   12-Feb-1992
Notes:          Once upon a time, some net.people made a joke about writing a
                program or two that simulated the Universe. Ho ho ho.  Pretty
                funny. But other people took them seriously and thus was born
                the short lived mailing list called usml, and thus were written
                a number of programs which simulated various parts of the
                universe. There are subsector generators for Traveller, star
                system generators using several methods, and plate tectonic
                generators to generate random land masses (not very pretty).

                Here are the contents of pub/usml:

                Actual                  accrete.c               shebs
                Archive                 accretion.amiga         siod.c
                Digests                 accretion.src           starcul.shar
                List                    archive                 starform
                OtherSun.src            cellsim_1.5.tar.Z       system.arc
                Psychohistory           fractal.c               traveller.tar
                README                  plates.c                xc5.1-tar.Z
                Universe                references

Well, the ftp site is timing out, and "archie usml" doesn't list anything,
so it looks like the archive is gone.  If anyone is interested in
reconstructing the archie, I have two of the files, fractal.c and plates.c,
which both generate terrain.  Plates.c has been hacked on to make the output
look better (without much success).
