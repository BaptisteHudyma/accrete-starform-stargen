TITLE: 20 year planet 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Saturday, 9 December 2000 19:48:17 UTC - Douglas Muir:
Thanks to Eric, Max and John for help with orbital calculations.
I've been messing around with the idea of a planet with a long year and
strongly differentiated seasons.  Here's a first draft.


The planet Nerval, Earthlike in most respects, orbits the brown dwarf Rimbaud.
  Rimbaud has a mass about 20 times that of Jupiter; it glows dully with about
0.0002 solar luminosity.  

Nerval orbits some 3.5 million km away, which means that it receives a bit
less than 40% of the insolation that Earth gets.

This would condemn the planet to a Mars-like deep freeze, except that Nerval,
in its turn, orbits the blue-white main sequence star Baudelaire.  Baudelaire
has two solar masses and is about twelve times as luminous as the Sun. 
Rimbaud has an eccentric orbit, swinging between 4 and 15 a.u. from its bright
primary (from just inside the orbit of Jupiter, out nearly to the orbit of
Uranus, in Solar System terms).  One orbit takes just over 20 years to complete.

At closest approach, the Nerval-Rimbaud system gets 0.75 the insolation that
Earth does; at apastron, that shrinks to a mere 0.045.  This means that
Nerval's /total/ insolation varies from about 45% of Earth's in "midwinter",
to about 115% at perihelion.

A rough blackbody calculation (assuming that Earth's average temperature is
290 absolute, and that temperature varies as the fourth root of insolation --
and yes, I know it wouldn't be that simple) suggests that Nerval's average
temperature would vary between about 52 degrees Celsius colder than Earth and
about 10 degrees warmer.

A back-of-the-envelope calculation gives Nerval a "month" of about 10 days. 
Since it's so close to Rimbaud, it will probably be tidally locked; just for
the hell of it, I'm going to say that it's a 3-2 resonance lock, like Mercury,
rather than a straight day-equals-month deal like the Moon.  This gives a
"day" that's about one week long, which will lead to lots of odd effects,
somewhat mitigated by the fact that the planet is illuminated from two
sources.  

To keep things simple, I'm assuming fairly flat orbits and little axial tilt.

Baudelaire is between one and two billion years old; it's probably nearing the
end of its time on the main sequence, but it has at least a hundred my to go
yet.  So there has been enough time for native life to evolve, if such is
desired, though it may not be out of the Paleozoic yet.  Let's say that things
have at least reached a late Precambrian stage, with seas full of life and
plenty of oxygen in the atmosphere.


So.

1)  Is this plausible?   We now know that lots of stars have massive
superjovian companions, some with quite eccentric orbits.  Any reason this
couldn't work?  (and, are my numbers correct to a first approximation?)

2)  How habitable is this place going to be?  How bad are winters?  I'm
assuming that Nerval is Earthlike in most respects other than its location, so
what happens when you vary an Earthlike world's solar flux by 150% over a
20-year cycle?  

I see both positive and negative feedback loops here.  At periastron, more
water vapor in the atmosphere will tend to increase the greenhouse effect; at
apastron, increased ice cover might bounce more light away.  Also, I think
that high latitudes will see C02 snow in late winter, which might cause a
downward spike in temperature.

UV flux will vary by even more than net temperature, since Rimbaud produces
almost no UV while Baudelaire's light is much bluer than Sol's.  Possibly the
local plant life has two different chlorophyll equivalents, each capturing a
different set of wavelengths

Where would colonists live?  The equator?  How cold would it get there in
winter, and how hot in summer?

Any interesting consequences that I've overlooked here?


Thanks in advance,


Doug M.

For comparison purposes, the Earth is estimated to be 4.5Ga old, and the
Precambrian period ended with the appearance of animal fossils 0.5Ga ago. In
fact we didn't have an oxygen atmosphere for the first 2Ga. So things have
to happen at least twice as fast on your planet as on the Earth. Not that
that can't happen, but we only have the one data point.

Sure.  I'm somewhat arbitrarily assuming that things could indeed happen twice
as fast; since evolution is a highly contingent process, I don't think that's unreasonable.

(Yes, there's also a geological/chemical aspect, I know.  Let's just take the
Earthlike atmosphere as given for the time being.)

The 3:2 lock has two consequences you've missed:

First, Mercury's 3:2 lock is a consequence of its fairly eccentric
orbit. Tidal effects are stronger at perihelion, so the rotation has (to
oversimplify a bit) locked in on the orbital angular velocity at
perihelion, which is faster than the average. If Nerval's orbit is
eccentric, you've got yet another cause for temperature variation.

Second, your seven-day "day" is wrong. That's the sidereal rotation
period, but when it's combined with the orbital motion, it turns out
that the solar day for a planet in 3:2 resonance is _twice_ the orbit
period. So Nerval's day/night cycle takes 20 Earth days, not 7.

(The formula is 1/sidereal_day - 1/orbit_period = 1/solar_day.)

Also, because the day/night cycle is a combination of the (fixed angular
velocity) rotation and (variable angular velocity) orbit, the apparent
motion of the sun in the sky isn't the simple trajectory it is on Earth.
It sometimes moves forwards and backwards in its path, and from some
parts of the planet's surface, you'll get multiple sunrises and sunsets,
with the sun bobbing up and down over the horizon a couple of times
before crossing the sky.

BTW, if Rimbaud is the normal size for a brown dwarf, its apparent
diameter in Nerval's sky is about 2.5 degrees, five times the size of
the Sun or Moon in ours. Its visibility to the naked eye would probably
be almost entirely reflected light from the other star; most of its own
radiation is IR, and the "dark side" would be a very dim red, probably
not discernible against the daylight sky when the other star is visible
(the surface temperature would be around 2200 K).

(From theoretical calculations of the behaviour of highly compressed
matter, supported by what little we know about real brown dwarfs, it's
believed that planets and brown dwarfs have a more or less constant
diameter between Jupiter's mass and the smallest true stars. Density
increases instead of volume, until large-scale nuclear reactions start
and expand the star.)

Whoa.  Now that I did not know.  Thank you!

(So, are resonance locks generally more likely to be found in eccentric
orbits?  How eccentric do they have to be?)

Eek.  I'm trying to keep things simple here, to just look at the consequences
of the 20-year cycle.  Throwing in another temperature curve makes things
messier.  What's the least eccentricity we can get away with?

[staring at formula]  Are you sure that's written right?  

But, okay -- I just play-acted this out with two CD-ROMs, and you're right; it
takes two complete orbits to get back to the same point.  Huh.  

Sometimes Usenet makes it all worthwhile.

Neat.  But this would be a result of the eccentricity of the orbit, right? 
That is, if the orbit were perfectly circular, we wouldn't see this effect;
and if it were only slightly eccentric, we'd see it only a little.

Yah, I was thinking that I should work that out.  Thanks.

(BTW, the Sun or Moon is about the size of your little fingernail held at
arm's length... there's a near-full Moon tonight, check it out.*)

Baudelaire, of course, would be teensy; at apastron it would be a tiny disk
(though still bright enough to dazzle), and would give about as much light as
dusk or a very overcast day.  At periastron Baudelaire would be a bit more
than a quarter the size of the sun, and looking at it would be begging for UV damage.

Oh, really?  Hm.  -- Where's that figure from?  I'm curious.

2200 K hat gives a peak output wavelength down in the IR, but if I'm
remembering my Planck curve correctly (and I may not be), we'd still be
getting on-the-order-of one percent of output in the visible spectrum.  That's
about as much light as a nearly-full moon, though smeared out over a larger
surface area... I think it would glow a very dull brick red, no?

Oh, and there's true moonlight sometimes; I didn't mention it, but Rimbaud has
at least one other large satellite -- Mars-sized Verlaine, in the next orbit
out.  At closest approach Verlaine will show a disk about half as big as the
Moon's.  So near apastron, at least, it would give a respectable amount of moonlight.

Yah, I'd been assuming that.

Any thoughts on climate?  I'm wondering about things like icefields -- how
fast they can form, how quickly they'll melt -- and also ambient temperatures generally.

But anyhow, thanks for the very informative post.

It all sounds fairly plausible, but other members of the group can probably check
the mathematics better than I can. One issue is that brown dwarfs seem to be very
rare, rarer than planets of a few Jupiter masses. Could the scenario work with just
the star as the heat source?

I'm wondering if the summer is hot enough to melt all the snow that forms in the
winter. If not, you get an positive feedback loop and the place is an iceball in a
century. It would be useful to plot a graph of temperature versus time to find out
how long the "seasons" are, and what the average temperature is. I've done this
myself while investigating the  real extrasolar planets, but I can't vouch for the
accuracy of my formula so I won't inflict it on you. In general winter lasts a lot
longer than summer. If you want to prevent your planet freezing over, make sure
there's free circulation of water from the tropics to the poles, no polar continents
or enclosed polar oceans like the Arctic. You want to keep the continent sizes small
and put them in the tropics.  Colonists will live at the equator, and they'll just
put up with the year or so when it's unpleasantly hot.

My favorite line in French poetry is that bit about the "tour abolie", and
somehow this world made me think of it.  I suppose glaciers going back and
forth every 20 years would render a lot of things abolie.

Strictly speaking, it should have been named Verlaine (the companion of
Rimbaud), but I'm assuming the colonists balked at naming their planet after a
 creep who _wasn't_ a first rate poet.  So Verlaine is the next planet out.

Really?  I didn't know that.  Source?

We either have to shorten the year or make the star brighter.  

Shortening the year is less interesting to me; I picked 20 years as a minimum,
for the drama of the thing.

Making the star brighter works, but then it leaves the main sequence faster,
so the maximum possible age of the planet gets younger and younger.  The
problem with this is that, absent terraforming, it takes a while for a planet
to generate a breathably oxygen-rich atmosphere.  Earth didn't manage it until
the late Precambrian, more than three billion years after the planet formed. 
I think it could happen faster than that, but I wouldn't want to push it much
below a billion years or so.

Well, at periastron it's getting about 115% as much energy as Earth, and this
goes on for a couple of years.  This won't melt all the ice -- the poles will
always have some -- but it should get rid of a lot of it.

If need be, we can nudge periastron in just a bit; moving periastron from 4
a.u. to 3.5. a.u. cooks things up considerably without changing the length of
the year much.

No, no, toss it out, please.  If it's wrong there are people here who'll
cheerfully pick it apart.

I want to do a spreadsheet, myself, with total insolation graphed across time.
 I'd have to think a bit about the equations, though; I'm not sure how
movement across an elliptical orbit is described.  Any suggestions are welcome
(I'm using Excel).



>In general winter lasts a lot

Sure.  A couple of years of summer, maybe three years each of spring and fall,
twelve years of winter, is what it looks like.

Good point about the continents.  Mind, Earth's poles have been open ocean for
most of the planet's history; the present situation is a bit unusual.

After a bit of checking I can correct that statement. Up until 1995 the methods used to
look for extrasolar planets didn't detect any brown dwarfs so they were thought to be
very rare. Then lots of brown dwarfs started being discovered by direct observation, so
they were actually common. And the Doppler shift  methods found a few after 1997, too.
But brown dwarfs orbiting high-mass stars, like your scenario, are still very rare. The
Doppler shift methods found only five, compared to more than 40 planets.

That's what I'm afraid of :)
OK, I have an angle A that has some significance in the orbit. In the spreadsheet I just
start it at pi and run it down in pi/400 increments, using 800 rows so completes a full
circle.  I have two other coloumns that give sin A and cos A. The time value is given by
(e*(A-e*sinA)/2.3247786)-0.5, where e is the eccentricity. Don't ask me to explain the
other numbers. The distance between the planet/dwarf and the star is given by
s*(1-e*cosA), where s is the semimajor axis. This gives you 800 time values and the
corresponding distance values, which you can use as X and Y values in a graph. Working
out the insolation or temperature at different times is just a matter of plugging the
distances into standard worldbuilding equations.

Resonance locks at ratios other than 1:1 are likely to be found in
eccentric orbits. Higher eccentricities will give a preference for
higher resonance ratios (3:2, 2:1, 5:2, 3:1, etc; maybe the occasional
intermediate case like 5:3). There'll be a relationship between the
eccentricity and the most likely ratio, but I don't know the specific
numbers.

Well, Mercury's eccentricity is about 0.2. I don't know just how much
you'd need for a 3:2 resonance to be plausible, but you should be able
to get away with 0.1. That gives a ratio of about 1.5 in illumination
between periastron and apastron.

Yep. Example: Earth's solar day is 24 hours, sidereal day is 23h56m,
year is 365.25 days (roughly) or 8766 hours.

    1      1       1
  ----- - ---- = -----
  23.93   8766   24.00

(The reason for the formula becomes clearer if you think in terms of
angular velocities.)

From the luminosity you quoted (0.0002 Sun), the diameter of a brown
dwarf (about 150 000 km), and the black-body law. Real stars aren't
blackbodies, but it'll be correct to within 100 K or so.

(Or exactly correct by the usual astronomical definition. The
temperature normally quoted for stars is the "effective temperature",
which is defined to be the temperature of a blackbody with the same
luminosity per unit surface area; this is only approximately equal to
the thermodynamic temperature, but there's no way to directly measure
that (well, you can deduce it from Doppler smearing of the spectral
lines, but that's even less accurate for most stars).)

Ok, some remarks.

That moon will probably quite volcanic, like Jupiter's moons.

If there is any difference in the rotational plane of the moons and the
planets, the climate at the poles would be truely extreme.

You can get a very good approximation by using Kepler's third law: the
line joining sun and planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times.
Divide the orbit into a large number of segments, say 360 one-degree
segments. Calculate the distance from sun to planet at the centre of
each segment, and approximate the area of the segment as that distance
times the angle (since you only need relative areas, don't bother
multiplying by the angle). Add up all the areas, and then you can get
the time to cross each segment by dividing the segment's area by the
total, times the orbit period. This should all be easy with a
spreadsheet.

Polar equation of an ellipse, with one focus at the origin:

  r = a.(1 - e^2)/(1 - e cos phi)

(where a = semimajor axis, e = eccentricity, phi = polar angle)

OK, let's cheat.
We take two stars with about 120% of Sol's luminosity orbiting extremely
closely. That's the tricky part. I am not sure how close they can be.

Then make the planet not a brown dwarf but a very small star 10% solar
mass. Stellar flares might become a problem.

Now have an orbital plane around the small star inclined about 90° to the
orbital plane of the larger stars.

You even get seasons of equal length.

I'd be cautious about assuming it must take so much time.

On Earth, the O2 in the atmosphere comes from photosynthesis
followed by burial of some of the reduced organic matter
(if it is left at the surface, it reoxidizes almost
immediately, causing no net increase in atmospheric O2.)

The time scale for this can be estimated by a thought
experiment: kill all life on the planet, and see how long
it takes for emission of reduced gases from volcanoes
and erosion of reduced materials in the crust (organics,
ferrous iron, sulfur, etc.) to consume the oxygen.

The answer you get is roughly a million years.  Now, maybe
the *first time* it happens it must take longer (since
by now the crust may be more oxidized than it was back
then), but maybe not.  The time delay on Earth may have
been just an historical accident.

Sounds like Helliconia by Brian Aldiss, but with much shorter
longyears (Helliconia's are a few thousand years, with a huge main
star).

I doubt the planet's orbit would be stable - it's a 3-body problem so
gets chaotic. especially if there are any other planets around.

I got about halfway through the Helliconia trilogy before throwing it over;
there were /big/ holes in the worldbuilding.  Frex, the huge main star was a
supergiant that could only spend a few tens of millions of years on the main
sequence.  Yet the planet had a complex ecology, with all sorts of adaptations
to the "great year".

Someone told me that Aldiss eventually resolved this, but I never got that
far, and anyhow there were lots of other problems.

No, it'd be stable.  It's orbiting quite close to the primary, which is
orbiting quite far from the sun -- about 3.7 million km and (at closest
approach) 600 million km, respectively.

A bigger concern is whether the primary has a lot of junk in orbit -- other
moons, rings, what have you.  I've waved my hand and said "no"; there's one
other biggish moon, Marslike Verlaine, and some dinky stuff, and that's it.

   I'd agree with Paul that you can shorten that timespan considerably
if you wish - what prevented the build up of O2 in the Earth's
atmosphere was not slow production, but the oxidation of nearly
everything else (primarly iron and sulfur) in the crustal system.

   Actually, the planet orbits the brown dwarf so close it's orbit would
be stable (baring resonance effects). Any small body orbiting within
rough 0.2 AU of the brown dwarf would be stable against perturbations
from the more massive star at periastron, and he's set the planet only
0.024 AU out. The brown dwarf is 100 times larger than Jupiter (in mass
ratio), but the planet orbits only about 80% further out the Callisto.

   Well, the only reason Jupiter's moons are volcanic is due to tidal
energy being dissipated in them - this planet of a brown dwarf would
have been tidally locked for a *loong* time, so unless there are other
similar sized moons in a mean-motion resonance with it (a'la
Io-Europa-Ganymede), I suspect there's not enough heat source to drive
much. Once every 20 year approaches to the massive star *might* do
something, but it's far from obvious what.

   Ditto if we throw any significant obliquity for the brown dwarf or
it's planet. Although I think it's really a question of what the brown
dwarf's obliquity is - it's planet will orbit in the equatorial plane (I
think; there's a limit for that, and I've not calculated it explicitly
yet), and tidal forces will reduce the planet's own obliquity to zero rapidly.

In an ideal universe:

   where W = sidereal years / sidereal days (ie- Mercury 2:3 = 2/3)

If the eccentricity is below, oh, say 0.1, then you're likely to fall
into a 1:1 orbital lock, not some higher resonance. As you say, this is
more a probability argument than a rigid constraint, but it's handy.

   Question for the future: how "Earthlike"? What's the
radius/mass/gravity, and what's the atmosphere like? Can we assume a
80/20 N2/O2 mix at 1 Atm under a gravity of 1 G? How much is ocean, and
where are the continents located? For the purposes of climate, this
stuff is helpful.

   While I've read your exchange with Ross Smith, I'm curious to know if
there's a good way to determine luminosity (or equivilently surface
temperature) for these objects at a given mass & age. I'll take the
75,000 km radius as a given, I guess.

   Fair enough. If you want a "harder-SF" solution (in this case meaning
more complex, not neccessarily more correct), you could apply the
iterative solution that Martyn Fogg used in on of his papers (I've the
details if you want them). He takes into account a rough greenhouse
effect (but see below) as well as albedo feedbacks (ice & clouds, very
roughly). Two big factors are going to be thermal inertia of the system
(want to moderate the climate? Use more atmosphere), and the response
time (OK, similar effect). Periastron may be too short to raise the
actual temperature much, due to ocean evaporation limiting the thermal
response for instance.

> Since it's so close to Rimbaud, it will probably be tidally locked...

The distance for tidal locking from a star is approximately:

   a_lock = 0.104 [ (k2/Q) T P M^2 / rho ]^(1/6)
      k2/Q = factors dealing with the planet; rough estimate, 3.31e-3
      T = age of system, in years
      P = inital rotation period of planet, in hours
      M = mass of central star, in solar masses
      rho = planetary density in kg/m^3

For Rimbaud, a_lock is around 0.124 AU out, assuming an age of 1 billion
years. The planet would be well and truly tidally locked, and would have
been for essentially all it's existance.

> I'm going to say that it's a 3-2 resonance lock...

   As others have pointed out, probably not without a significantly
eccentric orbit. But if you need an eccentric orbit to maintain a
day/night cycle of some type, it still might be OK for climate - while
the insolation recieved from Rimbaud will vary over the 9.5 day cycle,
thermal inertia might save you. Once again, if you assume that minimum
eccentricty of 0.1, that's an insolation variation of about 50%.
   I'm gussing you want to avoid 1:1 tidal lock to avoid the
complications of a "one faced" world? It's doable, although I've never
wroked out how easy oceans are in these settings.

> 1)  Is this plausible?

   Seems like it to me.

   Your numbers are good enough that you should be answering such posts,
not authoring them :-). The only differences I came up with were on the
order of 10% or so, lost in the noise and significant figures.

   First you've got to work out exactly how the insolation varies over
time, as Gareth Wilson suggested. Then figure out if at any time in the
orbit the planet can not reach equilibrium at hte rate heat is being
driven through the system - if that happens, then a simple equilibrium
model of a black body temperature response is obviously out.

   Those are both positive feedbacks. Evaporating water might also
moderate the temperature increase, removing heat from the equatorial
regions (latent heat effects) and transporting it to the polar regions.
And the big bugaboo is cloud cover - more water vapor, more clouds,
higher albedo, lower heat input. Water *vapor* is a greenhouse gas, and
a good one... but it's not always there as a vapor.

   Baudelaire will produce sixty times more UV than our Sun, which is
still almost four times solar at periastron. I'm very curious what sort
of ozone layer would form (cyclic, with a 20 year period? How fast does
it form an decay?).

   Maybe, but I'd go for two seperate ecospheres - one optimized for the
long winter, one for the brief summer. Probably more efficient, and more
interesting, with maybe one or two species that try to thrive in both
conditions (why? So that they have a better shot during fall & spring).

   Near a big body of water (climate moderation again)


> Any interesting consequences that I've overlooked here?
   Consider that a lot of greenhouse gases are actually going to
increase your effective albedo during much of the year (ie- an
atmosphere that absorbs IR frequencies will also prevent said
frequencies from reaching the ground as they come from Rimbaud).

Right.  In fact, Jupiter is right around the maximum volume mark;
objects significantly more massive than Jupiter are _smaller_, up until

That is not currently known; it is commonly thought that there are
probably more brown dwarfs than red dwarfs (if you follow the population
curve, lower mass means greater numbers).

It's really not known how the distribution changes when you go from
brown dwarfs to jovian planets (especially when there are no sharp,
well-defined boundaries).  It is highly premature, I think, to state
that brown dwarfs are rarer than large jovians.

As noted, I've half-arbitrarily assumed that it will glow a very dull brick
red, giving roughly about as much light as a full moon.

In winter, things will be rather dim as well as cold, since the planet won't
get much light from distant Baudelaire either.

Note that brown dwarfs emit the heat from their own formation and slow

Yes, to a first approximation -- give or take 10%.  As you point out below,
tweaking these factors can be interesting (thicker atmosphere buffers climate,
etc.), but I'd like to keep it simple for now.

Roughly 3/1 water/land, much like Earth.  Not much land at the poles;
otherwise similar to Earth, with several separate continents scattered around
the planet.

There might be a bit more vulcanism, but this is more because Nerval is
younger than Earth (c. 1.5 gy instead of 4.5) than because of tidal effects.

I think it's far enough away that there won't be charged-particle and
magnetosphere types of issues with the primary, though of course we don't know
enough about brown dwarves.

I'd be interested, yes.  Although my impression is that you're quite right --
the "harder" answer isn't likely to be that much more precise (or more

I'm going to squint hard and squeeze the eccentricity down to 0.08, which
gives a variation of less than 30%... much less at apastron, of course, when
most insolation is coming from blue Baudelaire.

At periastron, 15 a.u. out, it would be getting 60/15^2 as much, or about
0.28... right?

At apastron, yah, things get crispy; take your melanin pills, cover up, and
just stay out of direct sunlight as much as possible.

Hah.  I like this idea in principle, but boy are there a lot of details to be
worked out.  At periastron the planet's getting more energy than Earth, and
_lots_ more UV, though it may not actually be warmer (since thawing it out of
its long winter will soak up an immense amount of heat).  During winter most
of the planet is superarctic, almost Martian; the equator occasionally goes
above freezing, but not for long, and CO2 will fall as snow in high latitudes.

Yeah, it would almost have to be two separate ecologies, with summer's being
much more energetic.

(Idle curiousity: does anyone know what CO2 snow in an Earthlike atmosphere
would look like?  Tiny specks, big fluffy flakes?  What kind of crystalline
structure does solid CO2 have?)

As migration approached, two elderly vultures doubted they could
make the trip south, so they decided to go by airplane. When they
checked their baggage,the attendant noticed that they were carrying
two dead raccoons.

"Do you wish to check those raccoons through as luggage?" he asked.

"No, thanks," replied one of the vultures. "They're carrion."

Heh.  I know someone who claims, with a straight face, that Rimbaud and
Verlaine are the true fathers of modernity.

It also drives home that this is not a world with hot and cold seasons; it's a
frickin' cold world that gets hit with a heat pulse a couple of years out of
every 20.  12 out of 20 years it's getting less than half the radiation that
Earth does, and the "hot" part of the orbit is just 1.2 years long.

Hm.  This makes it pretty inhospitable. I'm torn between tweaking the orbits
to warm things up a bit, and leaving it in its stark and brutal beauty.

Okay, it's just a wee bit _too_ cold.  This planet is nearly Martian for 12
years out of 20.  Might be interesting to visit, but nobody's going to live
there absent terraforming, unless Earthlike planets are really horribly rare.

So let me tweak it just a little bit.

1)  I'm moving it a bit closer to Rimbaud -- enough to turn up the heat a
little.  Average heat from Rimbaud is now 0.45 instead of 0.4.  This will also
shorten the "day" a bit, but never mind that just now.

2)  Let's also move apastron in a bit, from 4 a.u. to 3.6 a.u.  This means that

-- at apastron Nerval will receive 0.93 sols from Baudelaire, instead of 0.75;

-- the year gets a bit shorter (in fact, it now is just a hair over 20 years); and,

-- total insolation will now vary from 0.5 (low) to 1.48 (high).

Summer will still be short, but we should now see some steam; the heat pulse
should be intense enough to melt the ice and make things wild and crazy for a
year or two.

Does this work for you guys?  Anyone want to do the chart?

Distance from the centre to one focus, divided by the semi-major axis.

Assuming the periastron stays the same, you've now got a semi-major axis of 9.3 and an
eccentricity of 0.61.

Plugging these values, using 20 years for the period and starting at apastron, you get:
Time (years)   Insolation
3.2                    0.5
5.8                    0.51
8.1                    0.55
9.7                    0.66
10.8                  0.99
11.5                 1.36
12.2                  0.99

Sorry about the funny increments. The heat pulse doesn't seem to last much longer, but
it's much more intense.

It indeed does. For bodies of equal density and mass, it turns out to be

I sure no reason, why not. The moons of Uranus are in stable orbits.
After all the gravitic force is the same, orbital planes different or not.

Looked at like that (and compared with Jupter's moons), I stand
corrected.

Incidentally, astronomers have found evidence of planetary formation
in double star systems (New Scientist 25/11/00 p20 & Astrophysical
Journal v543 p328).

> I'd be interested, [in Martyn Fogg's method]

   OK, here it goes. It's basicly three steps that you iterate through
until the predicted surface temperature converges (till the change is
less than 1 K or so between iterations).

1) Calculate an effective temperature, Teff:
   Teff = Teff_earth ( [(1-A)/(1-Ae)] L / a^2 )^(1/4) 
      Teff_earth = 255 K
      Ae = 0.3 (Earth's global albedo, roughly)
      A =      (planet's albedo)
      L =      (stellar luminosity, in terms of the Sun's)
      a =      (planet's orbital distance, in AU)

2) Calculate greenhouse correction (based on optical depth, Tau):
   Tg = [ (1 + ( 3 Tau / 4 ))^(1/4) - 1 ] Teff Fconv
      Tau = Tau_H2O + Tau_CO2
         Tau_H2O = 0.15 ( q_planet / q_earth )^(1/2)
         Tau_CO2 = 2.34 ( q_planet / q_earth )^(1/2)
            q_i = mass of atmospheric gas on earth or planet
                  (if you want to correct for H2O feedbacks, use
                  the q_water calculation in the step below)
      Fconv = 0.43 (parameter to allow for convective mixing)

3) Calculate the surface temperature & a new effective albedo:
   Tsurf = Teff + Tg
   A = F_c A_c + (1-F_c) ( F_i A_i + F_w + A_w + F_r A_r + F_v A_v )
      F_c = 3.752e-17 q_water
         q_water = 1.258e+16 exp[ 0.0698 ( Tsurf - 288 ) ]
      A_c = 0.52 (albedo of clouds)
      F_i = ( (328 - Tsurf) / 70 )^5
      A_i = 0.70 (albedo of ice)
      F_w = fraction of the surface covered with water
      A_w = 0.04 (albedo of the open ocean)
      F_r, F_v = fraction of surface covered with (r)ock or (v)egetation
      A_r = 0.15 (albedo of rock)
      A_v = 0.13 (albedo of vegetation)

4) Repeat step 1) to derive the next Tsurf, until Tsurf stops changing.

   I'm certain of it, but I like this method because (a) it's really not
too hard (honest!), (b) it takes into account both greenhouse feedbacks
with water vapor or different atmospheric mixes, and roughly albedo
feedbacks. Ignoring these is obviously wrong (it's like tossing out the
33 degree greenhouse correction for Earth), so it at least lulls me into
thinking I know whatI'm doing :-).

   Keep in mins that you can have the surface temperature go over the
boiling point of the oceans, at which point things blow up, and it will
also predict roughly when you reach global glaciation, although the
state-of-the-art has come a *long* way on that, invalidating this method.

   Well, hey, you asked... ;-)

   First Law of Ecology: you can never do just one thing. There are at
least two non-Earth-like implications of your set-up, the insolation
(the major point of this thread), and the *rotation*. Nerval is going to
rotate much slower than Earth, with a correspondingly weak Coriolis
parameter. But thanks for the clairification on just how "Earth-like"
we're talking.

   So at least you can assume heat-pumping ocean currents pretty easily.
Good, that was one thing I was curious about.

   Another great point that I completely missed! Earth's current flux is
around 0.070 W/m^2 (averages 1.7 W/m^2 in geothermal sites). ASSuming
the Earth's heat output is dominated by the mantle (not too bad), and
that in turn is controled by four primary isotopes, I get a heat flux
for a 1.5 Ga Earth around 2.4 times higher, quite significant.

   If you assume that the brown dwarf has at least a Jovian field,
Nerval is going to be *inside* Rimbaud's bow shock. This could be a good
thing, as it protects the upper atmosphere from solar wind stripping
during close approaches to Baudelaire... but only if the bow shock
remains outside 3.5 million km, which I'm not sure of. I know Jupiter's
bow shock distance, but I *don't* know how to scale it w.r.t. field
strength or solar wind strength (or for that matter how the solar wind
strength varies for a 2 Ms star).

   Given where all these numbers are coming from, you don't need to
squint too hard to use a small eccentrictiy and still allow a 3:2 locked
state - after all, we really only have one example ;-)


> Yah, I need to get around to setting up a spreadsheet for that.
   Well, the thread inspired me to finally work it out, sort of. If you
start with the angle that the planet makes from periastron (call it f),
you can derive both the time it took to get there (periastron passage is
time zero), and the distance from the star at the time rather simply:

Given f (angle between planet's position and periastron point in orbit):
   E = 2 ArcTan[ ((1-e)/(1+e))^(1/2) Tan(f/2) ]
   t = (P / 2pi ) ( E - e Sin(E) )
   r = a ( 1 - e Cos(E) )
Run this thru a spreadsheet, with each line a slightly different angle
(f), and you can get a pretty good idea pretty quick. And as long as you
have r calculated for every line, determining the insolation at a given
time is just one more column of cells.

   Sure - basicly because, upon reading it, I did a terrible job the
first time. The black body approximation assumes that the amount of
stellar energy coming in is equal to the amount of thermal energy
radiating away. In fact, unless the surface has a very very small
thermal inertia, this just isn't so - during the morning, for instance,
the energy in exceeds the energy out, and so the surface incerases in
temperature. The same thing happens on a seasonal scale for the Earth
(that's why the coldest day of the year is almost never the shortest day
of the year, for instance).
   Essentially I was talking about thermal lags and non-equlibrium
conditions, but I did a very poor job of it. Sorry 'bout that.

   Near as I can tell. To be honest, the numbers I quoted are based on
the assumption that star radiate as black bodies, which it turns out
fails rather miserably, *especially* at short wavelengths, but it's the
best I've got unless someone wants to dig up a bunch of spectral power
data for the different stellar types. I orginally calculated the numbers
to determine the power radiated at a short enough wavelength to split
water (195 nm), so that "60" includes everything shortwards of that.

   After posting that I realized that Hal Clement once again beat us all

this point, I figured you *liked* working out details, or you would have

   Size would depend on how you form it, and with as low a density as
CO2 takes in a (human-breathable) atmosphere, I suspect and CO2 precip
would be in tiny particles. I'm not even sure I can think of a mechanism
to "pack" CO2(s) into larger objects, like flakes or "Carbon dioxide men".

   Yeah, but one that I'm really unsure how to handle. I went around on
this a while ago, and found out that "greenhouse gases" for very
different temperature ranges are hard to figure out - nobody worries
about such things on Earth.

My concern isn't the inclination of the orbital plane.  It is that having
the brown dwarf floating around will result in occasional nudging of the
planet's orbit because the barycenter of the two stars will be wobbling,
sometimes moving closer to the planet and sometimes farther away.  That
seems like it might make the planet's orbit unstable.

For convenience, how about setting the year at 20.0 years?
For  Mbaud = 2 Msun  , that means  a = 9.3 AU . Any combination
of peribaud and apobaud which average out to that will work.

How about turning up the heat from Rimbaud by increasing its mass,
and thus luminosity? Instead of a dull red, make it a nice cherry red.

If you don't want seasons like Minnesota ("last year, summer was on
a Wednesday") you want an orbit which is less eccentric, not more.

The actual (overall) temperature is affected by the greenhouse
gases in the atmosphere. That will slow IR radiation out but,
as someone pointed out, it will also reduce Rimbaud's IR coming
in. The atmosphere will also block some (most?) of Baudelaire's
UV radiation. And then there's the overall albedo, which will
vary with the size of the ice caps. And then there's the planet's
thermal inertia... All of which should keep Nermal cold on the way
down, and (relatively) warm on the way back out.

I think I'd rather move it closer, which has the additional advantage of
shortening the overlong "day".

Well, sure.  This is why I want to keep as many variables constant as possible.

Frex, I think that an Earthlike planet with a 200-hour "day" would have pretty
negligible Coriolis force.  What it might have instead, I suspect, is some
sort of convection cell system between the cool and warm systems.  We don't
see this on Earth because the planet rotates too fast, and air moving north or
south gets deflected.  On Nerval, things might be otherwise.  But if we also
change atmospheric density, gravity, and what have you, it all becomes quite
difficult to visualize.

H'm?  Is there that much less CO2 in the atmosphere than water vapor?  If all
the CO2 in the atmosphere condensed out, how many cm of "snow" would it make?

We can make snowballs and snowmen because ice, under pressure, melts a little.
 Squeeze a handful of snow and you wet it just a bit.  Release the pressure
and it refreezes, binding the snow crystals back together.

We've all had the experience of trying to make a snowball from ice that's
either too wet or too dry; it won't pack (though you can work with fine, dry
snow if you squeeze a bit harder).

CO2, though, doesn't want to be liquid at Earthlike air pressure.  You'd have
to squeeze it *really* hard to pack it.  I suspect that it would be like very
fine sand or dust... does anyone out there know for certain?

CO2 snow on an earthlike planet is hardly dry.
And given sufficient time it will become ice, like ordinary snow.
To get liquid CO2 you need ~30 bars, not all that much pressure.

I have handeled solid CO2, but under lab conditions that stuff is too
"wet" and you can't form it by hand. Your gloves don't provide enough
insulation.

   Two was to do this. By analogy & by calculation.

   First, compare the situation to a similar situation in the solar
system that we *know* is stable. The mass ratio between the star & the
brown dwarf is about 100-to-1, while the Sun's ratio with Jupiter is
1000-to-1; other things being equal (Rimbaud's close approach is similar
to Jupiter's average distance), orbits about Rimbaud should be *more*
stable than jovian orbits. And Nerval orbits only 80% further out than Callisto.

   Second, a satellite orbit is stable if it orbits closer than about
1/3 a_hill, where a_hill is:

   a_hill = a ( m / (3M) )^(1/3)
      a = Moon's orbital radius
      m = planet's mass
      M = stellar mass

For Rimbaud, a_hill = 0.59 AU, so anything closer than about 0.2 AU
should be in a long-term stable orbit (at least w.r.t. stellar
perturbations). Nerval orbits well within this limit.

I didn't express that well.  You're right, the stars orbit a center of
gravity.  I believe it's a shared focus of the two ellipses that describe
their orbits.  (That point is at the center of a virtual line connecting
them if the stars are of equal mass.  If they're of different masses then
it's not at the center.)  If the two stars are the only objects involved
then the barycenter doesn't wobble.

Now, with three-body problems I'm out of my depth.  But my question ("Would
the orbit be stable?") arose because I wonder if the planet's orbit may be
perturbed when it draws relatively close to one of these stars.  However, I
recall from your original description that the stars are exceptionally close
together, so suppose the orbit would most likely be stable.

   Well, we sort of do - the direct thermal circulation is termed the
Hadley circulation, and the region dominated by it the Hadley cell.
There is also a direct cell near the poles (the polar cell; very weak,
really, and some people think it a bad description to even talk about
it) and a indirect cell (the Ferrel cell) inbetween.
   What I was getting at is the temperate zone, with clashing warm &
cold air masses(the baroclinic zone), is located at the northern
boundary of the Hadley cell, and how far north that cell extends depends
on the rotation, or more specificly a number called the thermal Rossby
number (all units are mks units):

   Ro = g H_tropo [ (T_eq - T_pole) / T_mean ] / ( omega^2 R^2 )
      H_tropo = height of the tropopause, *usually* where P = 0.2 Atm
      T_eq, T_pole, T_mean = equatorial, polar, and global mean temps
      omega = 2pi / P = angular rotation rate [rad/sec]
      R = planetary radius

You can rough out the latitudinal temperature gradient with the BB
approximation to get an estimate of this thermal Rossby number: it's
around 0.2 for Earth, while a much larger 100 for Venus, and partially
explains the different atmospheric circulations. The northern boundary
of the Hadley cell (in degrees) is then:

   theta = 90 / ( 1 + 17 exp[ -0.5846 (5.3 + ln(Ro)) ] )

(note: this is a vast simplification of a much more complex theoretical
derivation I ran across: any errors are my own, and *not* the original
paper's). This implies Earth's baroclinic zone is located around 30°
latitude, while for Venus it's 86° (no effective baroclinic zone).
   Assuming the latitudinal temperature gradient is Earth-like (1/3) and
and omega = 8.727e-6 rad/sec (a 200 hour sidereal day), I get Ro = 16,
which implies theta = 78°, much higher than on Earth; by this one
estimate, a large section of Nerval might be dominated by very stable
(tropical-type) weather, without a lot of frontal systems that
charecterize the baroclinic zones on Earth. With that high a thermal
Rossby number, it also might have superrotating winds aloft like Titan &
Venus do.

> come up with that figure?
   By taking the cuurent mantel abundances of the isotopes, and
calculating their abundances (& thus heat production) 3 Ga in the past,
based on their half-lives. The amount of heat produced at a time t is:

   H = H_o exp[ -lambda t]
      H_o = current heat  production [W/kg]
      lambda = decay constant for isotope in question

For instance, a rock w/ 1 ppm K-40 produces arouns 2.8e-11 W/kg. 4.6 Ga
ago (t = - 4.6e+9 years), it would have produced 3.6e-10 W/kg (lambda
for K-40 is approximately 5.55e-10 years^-1), or about 13 times as much
heat. Now all you need to know are the heat production of the isotopes
currently. For undepleted mantle currently, U-238 produces 1.9e-12 W/kg
(lambda = 1.55e-10 years^-1), U-235 produces 8.2e-14 (lambda =
9.85e-10), Th-232 is 2.7e-12 (lambda = 4.95e-11), & K-40 is 6.7e-13
(lambda = 5.55e-10, roughly).
   Does that make sense? You can adjust this by using diffeent relative
proportions on the isotopes, of course, and you really have to figure
out each isotope individually and then add them up.

   It would also imply greater rates of CO2 recycling via oceanic crust
subduction. The system balances in most cases, so I don't think this is
too much of a worry overall (great for "local color" however).

   Good thought, IMHO. I suspect you would have roughly the same flux in
geothermal areas (1-2 W/m^2), but more of them, although it's just a
hunch, no data or calcs to back it up.

   Planetary B-fields are something I'm only beginning to realize are
very relevant, for atmospheric issues at least. This was pointed out to
me by some of the Contact worldbuilders and I'm still trying to work out
the consequences for habitable moons of M dwarf gas giants (a somewhat
similar issue to Nerval/Rimbaud).

   ...for 1.5 Ga or so - equivilent to worrying if a terrestrial
atmosphere could be striped in 75 Ma at a distance of 4 AU from a 2 Ms,
12 solar luminosity star. I state the problem that way so somebody more
knowledgable than me can hit it, I'm rather clueless on even a BotE
estiamte I'd trust on this.


> H'm?  Is there that much less CO2 in the atmosphere than water vapor?
   Um, well,... of *course* I checked this before posting... [sounds of
rapid behind-the-back math]... OK, there's not *that* much less CO2, but
it's still significant. 350 ppm CO2 is equivilent (I think) to 0.35 mb,
while the partial pressure of water in saturated air at 280 K is around
12 mb. Not as big a difference as I first assumed, but still
significant. Keep in mind you don't see water snow at very cold
temperatures, mostly (I assume) due to a lack of water vapor.

   Not much? Depends critically on the density of the precipitate.

How exactly did you do it? Have you spreadsheeted up the tough half of
the Kepler problem, or is there some simple way the rest of us can
generate such a table w/out successive approximation?
   Heck yeah I should know this - but elliptic integrals were always a

H'm.  So... raising the planet's gravity, or the height of its troposphere, or
the difference between equatorial and polar temperature would increase this
Rossby number, while increasing its size or the speed of its rotation would
tend to decrease it... do I have that right?

And a bigger Rossby number means a wider "tropical" belt of (relatively)
stable weather?

Wouldn't the Rossby number change at apastron?

If nothing else, surely there'd be thermal expansion of the atmosphere,
raising the troposphere.

Yeah... weathering is a big part of the CO2 cycle too, though.  And there
won't be too much rain through most of the year to wash CO2 out of the atmosphere.

OTOH, spring/summer/fall will have plenty of wild weather and lots of erosion.
 So maybe that balances, too.

I think at least some of the colonists are going to live in heated (but not
pressurized) domes, with Earthlight lamps, heaters, and pocket-sized Terran ecosystems.

Given the planet's marginal habitability, the colonists can't really survive
without at least 20th century technology; at a minimum, they need electricity
to run lamps to grow Earth-plants for food.  Paradoxically, this has made them
relectant to trust _very_ advanced technology, unless it's very very very
sturdy and redundant.

Geothermal power suits them very well.  It's about the simplest generation
method imaginable (drill a hole, stick a pipe in it, attach a turbine and
generator); you _can_ use all sorts of high tech to make it work better, but
you can make do with 19th century tools if need be.

Ah, interesting.  Why put it around the GG instead of the sun itself, though?

That's right.  Very cold air won't hold water vapor at all, or barely.

So CO2 snow would probably be rare, and tiny specks rather than flakes.  Still
happen sometimes, though.  Okay.

   My error, I mis-read what subthread I was answering too. That said, I
never understood the initial post by Oliver. Can you explain it again?
For a red dwarf orbiting a tightly bound massive binary, I would think
you would have the same insolation as if you replace the binary with a
solitary (and slightly more massive) star.

Unlike water, CO2 is non-polar: there are no nonbonding orbitals on
the C, so it's a straight symmetric molecule O=C=O. As a result, I
doubt it would have any cohesion to speak of. Much more dominant would
be any trace of water, which would combine with the CO2 to produce
carbonic acid, which is clearly polar (pKa1 of about 6). As a result,
a saturated CO2/water snowball would have about 10 times the cohesion
of a pure water snowball. I think. I've not looked at this for 20
years.

   That's how I'd read the equation. The complication is that few of
those parameters are actually independant: the latitudinal themperature
gradient, for instance, depends on the atmospheric circulation, which is
what we're trying to figure out here. Likewise the tropopause height
depends on the atmospheric scale height, and thru that inversely on
gravity. So the term "g H_tropo" can be rewritten with no dependance on
gravity, if you wanted.

 
> And a bigger Rossby number means a wider "tropical" belt of
> (relatively) stable weather?
   Probably. The catch to all this is that I don't know how practical it
is on very slowly-spinning worlds like Titan or Venus. It gives some
nice estimates, but the flow regime is so different it makes me
sceptical (although the source does apply it to such systems, so it may
just be me).


> Wouldn't the Rossby number change at apastron?
   Well, maybe. Obviously the temperature changes, which will change the
scale height (& thus the tropopause height, as you mention), and *may*
change the dimensionless latitudinal temperature gradient (T_eq -
T_pole)/T_mean. But I'm not sure it changes it enough, particularly over
the short timespans we're talking about, to have much of an effect. It's
a very interesting idea however - I'd not thought about such
far-reaching changes in atmospheric circulation in this setting. It
could 
*really* play havoc with trying to determine the climate throughout the
year (fun!).


> If nothing else, surely there'd be thermal expansion of the 
> atmosphere, raising the troposphere.
   Using Bill Wood's numbers for a BB equlibrium surface temperature,
the tropopause would be around 7 km during the winter (17 of the 20
years), ramping suddenly up to as high as 8.9 km for just three years.
That changes the thermal Rossby number (& the poleward extent of the
Hadley zone) from 11.9 to 15.1. That's not huge - the baroclinic zone
would be around 76° latitude in the winter, and 78° in the brief summer.
   To throw in yet another wrinkle, if someone wants to yell at me that
the assumption of a constant tropopause height is unjustified (on Earth,
for instance, the tropopause is lower in the polar regions), feel free.
It doesn't shift the results that much (I think it was ignored in the
original paper as well).

> [on vulcanism -- snip another interesting equation -- h'm, I need

   Yes, that's how it starts... and soon you have pages & pages of them
(you didn't think I was pulling all this stuff out of my gray matter,
did you?). Organizing them becomes a real trick.

   I'm not sure you need rain to scavenge CO2 out of the atmosphere -
the sink for atmospheric CO2 is ultimately ocean carbonates, so it's
dissolving in the ocean that scavenges CO2. the bigger problem (to my
mind) is how the conventional carbonate/silicate cycle might work on a
world with such wildly varying climate, in particular CO2 snow. The
cycle as a whole should proceed "normally" (the time constants for
dissolution in the oceans and crustal recycling will buffer the system),
but that extra sink for CO2 may shift the "set-point" for the system, if

   Maybe... another possibility is genetic engineering to produce crops
that grow very rapidly during the "summer", enough to provide food
during the "winter". You might need more acres per person to produce the
food, but it's a possibility. Still another is seeing just how little
light you need - in sunlight, as little as 10-20 W/m^2 (or less) can
provide enough energy to grow (not fast, but at least grow). This won't
happen under the near-IR insolation from the brown dwarf, but it might
extend the growing season from the hot star (you would get down to 10
W/m^2 at a distance of around 40 AU, assuming a luminosity of 12 solar).
   Of course, if this is a plot point, forget it - not neccessary, just
there in case it's helpful.

   It's another way around the tidal locking issue. While a terrestrial
planet in the habitable zone would be tidally locked, a GG wouldn't -
it's a lot harder to dissipate energy there. So a large moon of such a
GG would have a regular day-night cycle while still remaining in the
habitable zone.
   You want another reason? It sounds like a very interesting setting
for science fiction in general. After all, why didn't you just pick a
run-of-the-mill Earth-like world ;-) ?

The same way you and Gareth suggested: used a spreadsheet
to calculate time(angle), dist(angle), insol(dist) and
temp(insol). Then I picked out the values of time at one
year intervals.

I do have an infinite series for angle(time), but only out
to the e^3 term -- not useful in this case.

'Fogg's Method' looks interesting. If I'm reading the dependencies
right I should start with some Tsurf_init and go q_water(Tsurf),
A(q_w), Teff(A), Tg(q_w,Teff), Tsurf(Teff,Tg), and around and around.
Is that right?

Another thought just occurred to me: ocean circulation.

Oceans have, like, mongo thermal mass.  Still, ocean temperature will change
with the long year, especially at the surface.  This will raise... issues...
with circulation.

Meanwhile the slower rotation gives less Coriolis force to drive currents.

Salinity... [clutches head].

Yeah, but it's rain that pushes the cycle along, and so sets the equilibrium point.

I mean, imagine two worlds starting with equal amounts of CO2 in the
atmosphere, equal levels of vulcanism pumping more in and equal capacity to
sink carbon in the oceans.  But one has more rain than the other (for whatever
reason).  The rainier one will find an equilibrium with less atmospheric CO2;
it's getting scrubbed out faster.  No?

Yeah, I think so.

I don't think it's going to be that big a deal.  CO2 only falls as snow in
high latitudes during winter.  And then, come spring, it goes straight back
into the atmosphere.

I think it's simpler to gengineer a few simple food plants that can grow by
Rimbaud's IR-rich light.   It may take some tinkering to get one sturdy enough
to survive and grow wild in an alien biochemistry, but not so tough that it's
going to take the place over, but it'd be worth doing.

Normal, non-engineered Earth plants will grow OK during spring, summer and
fall, as long as properly prepared soil is provided.  The colonists will miss
out on a lot of plants that require Earth-like seasons (apple pie will be
either a luxury or a legend), but the thing is doable.

[H'm.  Would I want to live on a planet without mangoes?]

Remind me again what the flux is at Earth-surface, temperate latitudes.

   I completely agree. The only out I can suggest, if you choose to
worry about it at all, is for the Earth right now roughly half the heat
transported to the pole is due to the atmopshere, and the other half due
to the oceans. Would this happen on Nerval? Almost certainly not - but
the positions of the continents would be critical as well, and I think a
3D GCM with coupled oceans is a little bit beyond where you want to go
with this.
   At some point, you have the advantage of declaring it "fiction" - if
a reader wants to run a GCM, more power to 'em.


> The rainier one will find an equilibrium with less atmospheric CO2;

   Well, the rainier one will lower the CO2 level, but not due to rain
per say but erosion. Increased rain -> faster erosion -> increased Ca
ions in ocean -> shifting chemical equlibrium towards CaCO3 ->
deposition of CaCO3, consequently drawing down dissolved CO2 levels ->
atmopsheric CO2 dissolves in now undersaturated oceans -> less CO2,
therefore less greenhouse warming -> lower temperature, less precipitation.
   It's a subtle difference (perhaps a non-difference), but I wasn't
sure how you were viewing the carbonate-silicate feedback.


>> but that extra sink for CO2 may shift the "set-point" for the system

> I don't think it's going to be that big a deal.
   My concern was that the carbonate-silicate feedback depends also on
the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere: more CO2 -> more CO2 into solution
-> more CaCO3 deposited. But on Nerval what's the pCO2 that the ocean is
in equilibruim with: the summer value (summer CO2 high is very short,
occuring on such a brief timespan the oceans can not come into
equilibrium with it)? The winter value (possibly closer, but not sure)?
Or something between the two (my best bet; but where inbetween)?
   Once again, I think we're worrying about trivial effects given the
wealth of other approximations that are being thrown in - it's just that
I like thinking about the trivia, it gives me a constant check on what's important.


> I think it's simpler to gengineer a few simple food plants that can

   If you are starting with terrestrial biochemistry, you may be in
trouble: there should be an absolute minimum energy that a chlorophyll
molecule can absorb - any less, and you can't knock an electron free,
you just warm it up slightly. And if you postulate accessory pigments to
capture low-energy photons, and then add up several so as to trigger the
higher-energy chlorophyll, well... it will be tricky. There are some
biochemical examples of this, sort of, I think... but it would be on my
list of "radical changes"

   I got this from Martyn Fogg's book "Terraforming" - it suprised me as
well. He says:
   "Undiluted sunlight is therefore adequate for some degree
    of photosynthesis as far from the Sun as [roughly] 50
    astronautical units... However, for reasonable rates of
    biomass production, some concentration or supplementation
    of natural sunlight will perhaps be required from the
    orbit of Jupiter on outwards."
If 1370 W/m^2 / (5 AU)^2 = 55 W/m^2 sunlight can provide "agriculture"
of some form (taking Jupiter's distance as the practical limit), then
that implies crops growing as far as 17 AU from Baudelaire (I assumed a
bolometric luminosity of 14 for the star (from your 2nd , and
"corrected" that to 11.6 to get the visual luminosity, which is closer
to what plants can use). That implies (if you can mitigate the
temperature issues) a year-around growing season (at least as a possibility).
   With regard to light levels on Nerval during the winter (I know, this
should be going under the "2nd draft" thread), using a visual luminosity
of 11.6 and an apocentron of 14.4 AU, implies a flux of more than 75 
W/m^2 - a very cloudy day on Earth is around 110 W/m^2, so this is more
than enough for the human visual system to see "daylight".


> Remind me again what the flux is at Earth-surface, temperate
> latitudes.
   Above the atmosphere, the solar constant is 1370 W/m^2 at 1 AU,
although much of this can be filtered out by the atmosphere, it's not
unusual to get between 700-1000 W/m^2 at noon on a sunny equatorial day.
I guess I should "correct" my illumination levels above to account for
atmospheric extinction & scattering as well... this might bring the 75
W/m^2 estimate down to 40 W/m^2 (still plenty bright enough; think of
the surface of a 40 W bulb spread out over a square meter - dim, but you
can see), and move the "growing limit" in from 17 AU to around 12 AU -
still a long growing season.

   Yes, although Fogg started with step (1), calculating Teff(A) with an
assumed inital value for A, 0.3 being a good rough start. If you look in
a lot of the ACCRETE-type world-generators around, some of them
(STARFORM for instance, I think) use this method. The description I

Heck, that was the easiest part. I just copied those columns,
pasted them into a text document, cut great swatches between
the nearest-to-integral times, prettied up the result a bit,
and pasted it into my post. It took longer to figure out why
my temperature values were ~100° too high. Next go 'round,
I'll add a column so I can sort for closeness-to-integrity.

from _Classical Dynamics_ by Marion, chap. 8.8:

theta(t)  =  T + 2 e sinT + (5/4) e^2 sin4T
               + (1/12) e^3 ( 13 sin6T - 3 sin2T ) + ...

where T == 2 pi t / period

This is the inverse of

T(theta)  =  2 arctan( sqrt[ (1-e)/(1+e) ] tan(theta/2) )
             - ( e sqrt(1-e^2) sin(theta) )/( 1 + e cos(theta) )

Okay, so starting with A_init = 0.3 and q_water_init =   oops--
What is the value for q_CO2_earth?  Are these q values in g/m^2,
moles/cm^2 or what? I thought the greenhouse effect was due to
water vapor much more than to CO2.

   You caught me. Unknown, although you could figure it out if you
really wanted to I guess - the idea of Fogg's implementation was that
everything was scaled as much as possible to the one example we have,
Earth. He assumed the total volatiles availible was proportional to the
mass of the planet (& inversely proportional to the mass of the central
star), so a planet with 2 Me would have twice Earth's inital volatiles.
He then further assumed that any planet experiencing insolations between
1580 W/m^2 (a runaway greenhouse limit) and 86 W/m^2 promptly deposit
99% of their volatile inventory as solids & liquids, thereby estimating
the inital surface pressure (in Atm) as:

   P_surf = Volatiles ( R_e / R )^2 (g/g_e)


> Are these q values in g/m^2, moles/cm^2 or what?
   since the equations only care about dimensionless quanities like
q_CO2_earth / q_CO2_planet, it doesn't matter.

   So did I, to be honest - I'll have to dig out some of my past
invokations of this routine to check exactly how that squares. I once
wrote Martyn about this routine (and others), but he said that the
actual code was pretty well lost (it was stored on punched tape, if I
recall - he did this some time ago).

Perhaps someday I'll integrate (over an orbit) the torque

Hm.  But if the eccentricity does not exactly coincide

W stabilizes slightly away from the rational!  This is absurd,
so what have I missed?  Does tide affect eccentricity?
