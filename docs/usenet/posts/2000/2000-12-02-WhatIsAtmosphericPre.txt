TITLE: What-Is: Atmospheric Pressure . . . 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Saturday, 2 December 2000 08:00:00 UTC - ameen . net:
From a hard science prospective, what atmospheric composition would
boost an atmopheres pressure and still be 'healthy' for human
consumption? Assuming a gravity of .6, .7, and .8. I have been told
that pressures below .8 are not fit for human consumption. I have also
read that water vapor and CO2 are good compounds to this end, but
risky.
Any help is appreciated.

CO2 is not helpful at all.  More than a few percent will kill you
at any pressure.

Water's vapor pressure is not helpful at any reasonable temperature.

Using even a standard 80/20 Nitrogen/Oxygen atmosphere, though, you
can do an amazing amount.  Look at a standard atmosphere table... 

Denver CO is at around a mile high (5,500 feet or so), and has a 12 PSI
atmospheric pressure (0.8 atm) and very few people have any problem
living in Denver (though some with chronic breathing problems may...).

At 10,000 feet you get down to 10 PSI (0.66 atm).  There are plenty 
of ski resorts at that altitude, again with many people doing fine.
Between 5 and 10 thousand feet (0.8 and 0.65 atm) you slowly increase
the number of people who will have problems at that altitude.

Mauna Kea is at around 4,200 meters (13,500 feet or so), and 8.5 PSI.
That's around 0.57 atm.  There are a bunch of telescopes up there,
and people live up there to operate the telescopes.  Each year, they
have some cases of people getting sick or failing to adapt to the
altitude and having to be driven down the hill rapidly to recover.
But as a general rule, average health grad students, professors,
and technicians are able to adapt to and effectively work at this
height and pressure.

Above that altitude you hit more and more problems.

Everest "Base Camp" is at around 17,000 feet.  Pressure there is
around 7.5 PSI (0.5 atm).  Some people get sick at "Base Camp"
each year, but as a general rule people in good health can slowly
ascend to that altitude and continue to operate there without getting
ill or severely degraded.

Everest's peak is around 8850 meters (29,028 feet).  Pressure is
around 4.75 PSI (0.32 atm).  Humans in world-class physical condition
can ascend Everest without supplimental oxygen, though generally
at the cost of detectable but minor brain damage even on the best
ascents and most healthy climbers.  As a general rule climbers
rarely go over 8,000 meters without supplimental oxygen; at 8 km
altitude you have 5.2 PSI (0.35 atm).  That is known as the "Death Zone",
where you have to get up and back down again quickly or risk permanent
harm or death due to oxygen depravation.

Note that with supplimental oxygen, these pressure levels are 
not a serious problem.  Many early spacecraft used 4 PSI pure oxygen
(and western spacesuits still do, though the Shuttle uses roughly
sea level pressure and gas mix).  At the peak of Everest, with
a 50/50 Oxygen/Nitrogen mix, you'd have around 2.4 PSI of Oxygen
in the breathing gas, which is equivalent to an altitude of around
10,000 feet (most people do fine, and just about anyone can adapt
and live on that oxygen partial pressure).

With pure oxygen, fit humans can survive as low as around 3.2 PSI of
total pressure, but below that you have physiological failures in the
gas exchange mechanisms in the lungs.  Space suits run at 4 PSI to
stay away from the limit and give a bit of safety margin both on suit
performance, in case it gets punctured or breaks, and in case an
astronaut is ill or impaired and their temporary useful limit is a bit
over 3.2 PSI pure O2).

   Well, you could have a partial pressure of N2 around 3 Atm, and O2
doesn't become toxic until perhaps 0.5 Atm. So a N2/O2 atmosphere like
Earth's could be survivable at around 3.5 Atm, with about 14% O2. If you
want exotic gas mixes, it could be higher (replace N2 with He, for
instance), but that's a little exotic.

   I'm confused. If you want a higher pressure, you can use more gas or
a higher gravity - I'm not sure why you'd want a lower gravity (*if* a
high-pressure breathable atmosphere is your only goal). As to pressures
below 0.8 Atm, those are very "fit for consumption" - you'd breath that
any time you went to 1880 m (6200') altitude, for instance.


> I have also read that water vapor and CO2 are good compounds to this

   I must be mis-interpreting something here, but the partial pressure
of water vapor in the atmopshere is set by the surface temperature, and
it will remain very low (unless the temperature is much to high for
human habitation). Similarly CO2 is toxic at very low partial pressures,
and so can't help much. Both of these are *terrible* gases to base a
high-pressure human breathable atmopshere on.

To ease your confusion, I have a planet with a lower density than
Earth's--and correspondingly lower gravity. [Diameter 9600 miles,
Density 3.64, gravity is ~.8] I don't like the diameter . . . I'd like
it to be smaller. The only reason why I don't drop the diameter is
because I do not want to sacrifice a realistic atmosphere.

I am trying to boost atmospheric pressure for a lower gravity planet
for it to remain normal. You and the other poster have clued me into
the Earth values and what to equate pressures to. That's a start. But,
if I drop the diameter (and correspondingly the gravity), I run the
risk of bleeding off the atmosphere too soon. I suppose my question
would be better worded as "How to avoid atmosphere bleed in a lower
gravity world?"

No, I misspoke. I keep forgetting that the amount of vapor is in
relation to the temperature. An earlier misconception that keeps
sneaking back into my mind.

   Is there some reason you don't want to raise the density? Your planet
is bigger than the Earth, but with a density lower than Mars.
Self-compression alone would likely drive the density higher.

   As both Henry & I mentioned, humans can breath at much lower
pressures than atmospheric. But as you mention,

   Which is a good point. To keep the atmosphere around for billions of
years, you want the mean molecular velocity to be well below escape
velocity at the exosphere. But the escape velocity from your planet is roughly:

   v_esc = sqrt( 2 R g ) = 11.2 km/sec

Almost exactly the same as for the Earth: given a similar gas
composition and a similar exosphere temperature, the situations are
analogous. You'll be likely to keep the atmosphere around for a long time.
   Furthermore, if this planet orbits a late-type (class M) star, with
little to no UV output, the exosphere may well be much cooler than
Earths in the first place, making it even less of a problem.

Right, Mars has a density of 3.94, IIRC. There is a reason to keep the
density lower . . . I'm trying to keep the industrial metal abundance
down. If I could up the density logically while maintaining this, I
would be more than happy to bump the density up. I admit I'm not that
much of a scientist, so would you please explain 'self-compression?'
Is this a 'legal' way to accomplish this?

As I understand, the luminosity of this M5 would be 10 percent the
Sun's, and the biozone is correspondingly only .1 AU--which makes for
a dizzying orbit.  So, I'm assuming that the relative brightness would
be the same, although the wavelength would naturally be lower. Close
enough for government work? :-)

Would it work to have your planet only partly habitable (the Lowlands)?
Niven's Canyon (Known Space) and Pournelle's Haven (Co-Dominion, War 
World) have very deep regions that have much higher pressure than the 
planetary average. Pournelle made good use of the marginal areas in 
his plotting, source of barbarian hordes and all that.

Not quite sure yet. The initial goal is to build a habitable world.
I've posted since then with a slight variation of this same planet. It
revolves around a M5 star, quite dim.

   To do that, just assume that there's not much metal in the *crust* -
partitioning between the crust and the mantle can take care of this for
you, while not altering the net density much. If there was more carbon
in  the protostellar nebula, for instance, it would have combined with
the left-over oxygen, leaving iron to combine with sulfur only and sink
to the core... nearly *all* of it.
   A nebula richer in carbon would result in a terrestrial planet where
iron is as rare (on the surface) as cobalt. Stephen Gillett mentions
this ("carbonosis") in his book "Worldbuilding".


> I admit I'm not that much of a scientist, so would you please explain

   Oh yes. The idea is that even solids are compressible under high
pressures, so while "normal" iron has a density around 7000-odd kg/m^3,
in the core the densities are up to 12,000 kg/m^3 or more, due to the
compression of the overlying material. The actual equations are complex
(read: I don't know them), but you can get a good estimate by using
solar system bodies.

   Certainly - one issue is who your audience is. If you had to satisfy
people like me (picky, annoying, and over-educated), then there are
better ways to do it. But you have to aim at your audience, and I fully
admit that people like me are sometimes a small proportion (witness the
success of many many sci-fi TV shows). But it takes very little extra
work to get much closer, mainly using the inverse square law.
   If you want to do this stuff right, Gillett's book "World-building"
is an excellent place to start (ISBN 0-89879-707-1). But to work out the
actual math for the above situation doesn't take more than a few
equations. A M5V star has a mass around 0.35 Ms, and a luminosity of
roughly 0.019 Ls (about 2% of the Sun's, not 10%). The light a planet
receives from the star drops with the square of the distance, so the
insolation on your planet would be proportional to L / a^2. If L = 0.019
Ls, then it has to be at a distance of sqrt(L) = 0.14 AU to receive
Earth-normal insolation. For your 10% luminosity figure (L = 0.1 Ls),
the proper distance for Earth-normal insolation would be 0.32 AU, more
than three times further out then you seem to be assuming.
   Also, there's some leeway in the amount of insolation a "habitable"
planet needs. Reasonable limits (luminosities in terms of the Sun's, and
orbital distances in terms of AU) are:

   a_inner = sqrt( L / 1.1  )    inner limit: closer & it's too hot
   a_outer = sqrt( L / 0.53 )    outer limit: further away & it freezes

Just take your stars luminosity and plug and chug.

Hmm, if lack of knowledge  = complexity, there are a great many
complex things I am involving myself with. :-) But, as in knowledge
there is no growth without risk.

Although my audience may not care so much, I am picky and annoying.
Education? Hmm, depends on the field. But, I have to have a certain
suspension of disbelief when I write, and not having a realistic
setting would always be on my mind.

I also have "Aliens and Alien Societies" (not Eilan and his Society)
(same publisher)  that manages to fill in some chinks left open in
"World-Building" I suppose I should confess that I am also resorting
to GURPS Space. It may not be overly precise, but it has reduced the
complexity of a formula or two.

   I enjoyed both of those, but was rather disappointed with "Space

also from the same series.

   And it generates real-feeling systems. Other sources are to take a
look at are any of the many many worldbuilding solar system generators,
almost all based on a program called ACCRETE. Some of these add
complicated routines on top to figure out tidal locking, atmospheric
composition, wtc. Nyrath's web site has a lot of links to such things:

http://www.clark.net/pub/nyrath/starmap.html <http://www.clark.net/pub/nyrath/starmap.html>
(specificly the misc. links section, I think)

Alien planet designer is another good site to look at: he gives many of
the equations needed as well:

http://www.compulink.co.uk/~vicarage/planets/ <http://www.compulink.co.uk/~vicarage/planets/>

And on the biological front (also has some calculations on the habitable
zone), try:

http://www.planetarybiology.com/ <http://www.planetarybiology.com/>

(he's writing an on-line textbook, and some of the chapters are good
intros to both simple habitable zone calculations as well as biochemistry).

When DOES it become a problem?

   I answered part of this at the top of this thread. Breathable mixes
have been used to simulated water depths of 701 m (around 70 Atm), using
a H2/O2 atmosphere with traces of N2, but as another poster has put it
about these deep diving mixes, they're "a witches brew". More
practically, N2 can be breathed at a partial pressure of at least 3 Atm
(higher in some people), while O2 isn't toxic until around 0.5 Atm, so
for a *likely* mix (N2/O2), you could have a survivable, breathable mix
at 3.5 Atm.
   At the very high pressure end, you can mix complex but survivable
atmospheres, but the ultimate limit may be the work of breathing - these
dense (due to pressure, not exotic component gases) mixes are hard work
to breath. I've seen estimates that the gas density limits you to
pressures lower than 160 Atm.
   At the low pressure end, an atmosphere of pure O2 is OK (for
breathing, anyway) at around 0.14 Atm, but highly flammable. For a safer
burning mix, make it 25% O2, 75% N2, at a minimum pressure a tad below
0.4 Atm.

what about other effects less directly concerned with pulmonary and respiratory

the lower atmospheric pressures? Would our hearing be affected? Flight?

   Well, those are the big ones, that if I recall actually limit the
maximum and minimum pressures.

   I'm not sure why, but I'm not sure why not either. Your nose does a
good job of retaining water vapor under dry (low relative humidity)
conditions, considering that the air leaving the lungs is saturated with
water (supersaturated w.r.t. most outside air temperatures). At very low
total pressures, when H2O(v) would account for a significant portion of
the airmass, this might be an issue (ie, if you have to condense 40% of
the air volume passing through the system), but I don't actually know of
any hard biometric limits on this (have to check the Bioastronautics
Databook - it might have something). Interesting point.


> Would our hearing be affected?
   Higher pressure -> higher speed of sound (@ fixed T), but that
usually wouldn't actually change what you hear. Denser gas might change
the vocal resonances subtly, but I've got no proof. BTW, if anyone wants
to argue how/why He changes the voice, feel free - I've now found
contradictory explanations in several different (current) medical and
physics text on the mechanism, ranging from the simple (low density gas
-> higher frequency) to the complex biological (He saturation changes
the tension in the vocal cords themselves). And inert gases can
certainly have biological effects.
   Something like a bat might have an adjustment period, as timing is
everything for their sonar system (they have essentially biological
delay lines built in, which I suspect depend somewhat on the local speed
of sound). However the fact that bats can be found at a variety of
altitudes (and in fact can navigate fine during rapid changes in
pressure - like when descending an entrance) makes it doubtful this is a
large effect.

   In general, easier with a denser atmosphere - I couldn't tell you how
much, however (if I double the gas density & keep the wing area &
gravity the same, how does the power requirement scale? And how does
this vary between flapping flight and airplane flight?).
   It could certainly make buoyant lift more practical, for technology
or biology.

   Other issues for humans that I *do* know you'd need to consider
include the work of breathing a dense gas mix (at about 8 Atm I'm told
you can feel the air eddy and swirl in your mouth as you breath), and
the much higher rate of heat loss (dense gas -> higher specific heat per
unit volume). And at very high pressures, things like High Pressure
Nervous Syndrome start to mess things up (one of the reasons you
actually start adding N2 back into a deep diving mix at very high
pressures - it counteracts the HPNS induced by high pressure He).

The ames stanford stuff I was drawing from leaned towards the likelihood of
lower pressures. I don't know if it would make it harder to get off the ground
or not, merely having fewer molecules to beat against may not affect things, as
long as there is still a lower pressure above the wing. Plus there is a gravity
gradient to take advantage of. My intuition would suggest a glider would not go
as far at the low limts of pressure suggested in this study, but I could easily
be wrong. The pressure gradient might differ as well, not sure if this would
create a higher frequency of 'ear popping' or not.

One of the web sites I've found that deals with it quite well in
layman's terms is at <http://www.avweb.com/toc/aeromed.html <http://www.avweb.com/toc/aeromed.html>>.  This
has a bunch of medical information of interest to pilots of
general aviation unpressurized aircraft, which operate up to 12.5-14kft
normally, or ~18-20 w/supplemental oxygen.

One of the things I was thinking about the other day is some idea of
how much O2 consumption can be reduced.  

Particularly <http://www.avweb.com/articles/respirat.html <http://www.avweb.com/articles/respirat.html>> gives me
the idea that with proper biofeedback and training, one can trade O2
efficiency and lower pressure for being very distracted by having to
think about breathing continuously, by taking the conditions down to
levels where Cheyne-Stokes breathing would normally set in.  

It would be a truly horrible experience, but for someone in a
long-duration transit or emergency situation where they didn't need
much mental acuity, it might be workable.  Perhaps even intubation &
artificial respiration in a closed feedback loop with a blood O2 sat
monitor.  (Not something I'd personally like to experience, to be
sure.)

My reason for pondering this is wondering just how far a
belter/orbital/colony/habitat/etc society could stretch resources if
e.g. the first hydroponics facility were near completion and resupply
was cut off too soon. (Particularly for political reasons, e.g. they'd
have a long enough period of diplomatic indications that things were
going sour to start a crash program.)

As an aside, there must be a relation between body mass and O2
consumption - what about having deep space workers acting as decision
operators for mechanized ships be quadruple amputees?  Sick thought, I 
know, but in a frontier environment w/ limited resources things can
get ugly.

It prints 'Just another Perl hacker,', as is traditional in Perl
groups.

If you'd like an analysis of how it works, email me.

ObSFS:

While undergoing a caffeine-enhanced state of mind, I got a very odd
idea:

If one placed a generating tether on one of Jupiter or Saturn's
ringlets, used the power to crack H2O, and used that to fuel a
long-burn engine, would you get more thrust out of the engines than
you would lose in the tether?  Gut instinct says no.  Obviously, if
you used one tether to directly run another tether, you'd lose.
However, with the rocket, you'll be getting thrust from the reaction
mass you're throwing out the back, so it wouldn't neccesarily violate
conservation of energy.

Dunno how you'd get it into a useful orbit after getting it to the
inner planets, though.

Sure.  Ought to work, even if it might not be practical.

Turn the problem around and assume you use most of the ringlet's mass
for reaction.  So you would effectively use the tether to generate
electricity, use that to drive 2H_2O -> 2H_2 + O_2, and then use the
reverse reaction to blast a suitably small chunk of the ringlet (and
perhaps also the tether and other equipment) off to escape velocity.

Generate enough spare fuel and save it.

No, I think I can crack it. :-) Thanks. Just curious. I don't think
I'm that obfuscated a Perl hack yet. But, I'm working on it. Just ask
my co-workers.
