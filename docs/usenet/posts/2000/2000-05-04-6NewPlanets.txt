Indeed.  And I hope that we will soon be finding them in further orbits
as well (and with low eccentricities!).

   Why? It's so much more fun when all your ideas & theories get tossed
out the window. Sigh... but people will still keep on using ACCRETE to
generate "realistic" looking systems I suppose...

Oh, don't get me wrong, these new and completely unexpected orbits are
every bit as fascinating as your run of the mill Sol-type system... but
isn't it assumed that with systems similar to our own, the odds of
eventually finding terrestrial worlds (once we reach that capability)
are greater?  Other Earths may indeed be very rare (or not, depending on
who you ask), but I would be thrilled to hear news of other Mars', or
Venus', or even Mercurys.

At any rate, regardless of the planet's nature, every new discovery, to
me, is thrilling.

What's interesting is that the version of Accrete (I forgot the program's
original name) that was mentioned in Icarus in the early 70's (C. Sagan
was one of the authors) showed systems with Jupiter and Saturn sized
planets (or larger) orbiting very near their primaries...

        BV,

        You're assuming it's a single object in orbit around the sun itself.
     Perhaps it's something the sun itself is in orbit around.  The galaxy is
     a large group of various objects orbiting their collective center of mass.
     The sun's orbit takes it around the galactic core once every 220-240 million
     years, but other stars/dust clouds/etc may have differing orbital
     velocities/parameters.  In that ~230 million years we may end up passing
     through the leading/trailing edges of various spiral arms, dust clouds, and
     other galactic structures in some kind of periodic way that ends up shaking
     loose objects in the Oort cloud.  Also, the suns orbit would take us through
     the galactic plane twice, and from what I've read it looks like younger stars
     (and perhaps the dust clouds they form from?) tend to hang out near the
     galactic plane, as opposed to older stars, or middle-aged stars like the sun.

     If this is the case, perhaps we could turn the problem on it's head and try
     to deduce the structure of the galaxy by analyzing the distributon of
     extinctions. :-) :-) (Just kidding!)



        Just offering an alternative (WAG) reason for the somewhat periodic nature
     of the extinctions.

Now that we can detect planets, what we need to do id try to detect that

alleged Nemesis object with the 26 megayear eccentric-as-fuck orbit. The
theory goes like this: A Jupiter style object in the above described orbit
reaches its perihelion in the Oort Cloud and fucks with the comets,
causing some to take the nose dive toward Sol. 

It seems extinctions occur periodically, once in 26 megayears or so. We
have another 9 megayears to go before this alleged object swings around

   Well, first off that's going to be hard, since to use the current
method of finding extrasolar planets they need to be, well, extrasolar -
you detect them by studying how the star moves relative to you, which is
tough if you're in orbit around it as well (*not* impossible, but more
difficult).
   Rather tougher, you'd need accurate measurements for an orbital
period or so - tough to do if you've got a loooong period.

   Considering that, *if* this theory is correct, we have around 9
million years left... I think time is on our side.

   Nearer, yes, but not even close to "near" in the sense that the
current extrasolar planets are found. ACRETE limited formation to
outside of 0.3 AU, and although one set of runs did produce "close" gas
giants, these were outside of 0.3 AU, and probably could not have formed
at that distance anyway by the mechanism being simulated (an ACRETE type
mechanism probably couldn't form a gas giant in the face of T-Tauri
winds & Jeans escape).
   Currently there are known extrasolar planets around 0.01 AU out from
the central star. Even if the ACRETE method had any theoretical validity
left (and it was a great step forward in it's day), these sorts of
systems fall well outside it's results. Sorry for the mini-rant, I
actually happen to really like ACRETE and the many variations.

   I guess that's one of my points - there's little to no evidence that

   If you mean "are worlds like ours likely to be found in systems like
ours?", I'd have to answer with a qualified yes. But it doesn'tmean that
systmes like ours are common, or even the most interesting (consider a
very large moon of one of these close-in jovians, for instance; in the
habitable zone for M dwarfs, which are far far more common than G2 types
like our own Sun).

   I completely agree with both points. I guess my scepticism is due to
the relative difficulty: detection of 0.003 M_jupiter objects in 1 AU
orbits is still a far cry from a Saturn-mass object. Hopefully soon, but
I'm not sure when.

Thanks Brian! I think there was a much later article by William Kaula that
modified some of the initial conditions to make more "realistic" systems.

I agree that Acrete is obsolete, but it was the first published planetary
system generator that I'm aware of (unless Dole's predates it).

I think it's still very much a selection effect - these searches just
aren't that sensitive to Jupiter sized objects with long periods - "When
all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail."

Oh, that's very true.  But, as you say, there is still selection effect
to consider.  Of course, even if migrating Jovian worlds which create 51
Pegasi-type solar systems are common early in a system's history, and we
see the result as many systems with close in gas giants, that does not
necessarily mean that there still couldn't be large terrestrial worlds
in favorable orbits.  It depends on how early these Jovians migrated
inward, and if they left enough time for other Terrestrial worlds to
form before planetary accretion stopped.  As far as I know, that is
something of an open ended question (but, admittedly, I'm quite a bit
behind on the latest papers on planetary formation).

Absolutely!  It does make me wonder what other wonderfully bizarre
systems might be out there, that would essentially thumb their noses at
our ideas of planetary formation.

That's why I tend to think that the Drake Equation, for one, needs to be
looked at with a more open mind.  As far as worlds that can support even
simple life, we have not only found candidates in our own Solar System
that we would never have before considered (Europa), but there are many
possible configurations out there.  In addition to the ones that you
suggested, I wonder if giant stars, producing thawing on previously
frozen worlds, might not create a transient habitable world.  Presuming
that life will crop up where conditions are favorable, every time (A big
presumption, I know), I can see a world about, say Antares that has
pools of liquid water, even oceans, that harbor some form of microbial
life.  Of course, it may not last long....

But then, I really like wild speculation, obviously!

I think we may have to wait until there is a planet detector in orbit,
or out by Jupiter (gads, I can't recall the name of the proposed
project, but it was a part of NASA's Origins Program, I believe).  I
wonder if it is even possible to detect worlds such as what you stated,
using current techniques.  Can Radial Velocity be refined down to that
level even, speaking theoretically?

   Thank you! I'll see what I can dig up next time I'm at the library. A
much more "realistic" version of Acrete was the "Silicon Creation"
program written by Martyn Fogg, to try to determine the distribution of
habitable worlds relative to stellar type (interesting articles
published in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society).

   Dole was the first publication based on Acrete - Sagan, Fogg, and
others then used it as a base to study the systems it produced. The
downfall of course is that while the systems "look" good, the physics
that was usedis now known to be oversimplified.

   I agree, and very well said. It's still interesting that there seem
to be so many of these "odd" systems out there, but at this point we can
speculate one way or the other quite a bit - at least the statistics on
planetary systems is moving beyond the n=1 case, even if selection
effects are a pain.

Perhaps others can provide the fine details I can't recall, but I
believe that there is more evidence out there than which places have
shown planets in the Doppler plots, and which have not. I believe that
searches for microlensing events that a Jupiter-sized and
Jupiter-distant (3-7 AU) planet would cause have found no such
planets, and that there is already talk of upper limits on how many
stars have such planets, and that the upper limit is something like
30%...

One way to help combat the selection effects is to keep in mind the
"negative" results many observations of systems have gotten so far.
I think that statistically we've determined that roughly 5% of all stars
(or maybe all G, H, and K stars, not sure) have planets; it's entirely
possible that the other 95% *are* systems much like our system and
simply have terrestial planets and far-away gas giants we can't detect
yet.  A few systems have been ruled out of having Jupiter-sized planets
at Jupiter distances, but they could still have them further out or have
terrestial planets.

Martyn Fogg was an occasional contributor to sci.astro. His articles in
JBIS are always thought provoking.

I think all we can say is that planetary systems are not rare, and that
there's more variety than we had assumed, based on our single example.
It'll be interesting to see how things evolve once radial velocity
measurements can detect Jupiter sized planets at "normal" distances. I
suspect that the detection rate will fall - at least at first - since the
periods will be much longer.

The NASA Origins program web page is here:

There are several proposals for space-based planetary detection systems.
For example, there's the Terrestrial Planet Finder.

http://tpf.jpl.nasa.gov/ <http://tpf.jpl.nasa.gov/>

Another interesting one is Kepler -- which, despite being "faster better
cheaper," does not appear to be funded yet:

http://www.kepler.arc.nasa.gov/ <http://www.kepler.arc.nasa.gov/>

These space-based detectors would not use Doppler measurements of radial
velocity to detect planets.  As you point out, it's probably not possible
to make Doppler measurements at the level of sensitivity required for the
detection of smaller objects.  A star is not a bowling-ball.  The surface
bubbles and boils.  This motion must at some level contribute to the
smearing of the atomic absorption lines used for Doppler shift
measurements and thus place a lower limit on this type of measurement.

Kepler would look for planetary transits of the kind seen last year at
HD209458 -- but, of course, with more sensitivity.  TPF (and, its
progenitors, ST-3 and SIM, which wouldn't be sensitive enough to detect
Earth around the Sun) is an interferometric telescope setup, akin to what
they're doing on the ground right now at Mauna Kea -- but again, much
better.  TPF would use multiple, widely-separated telescopes to a)
increase the angular resolution and b) use interferometric nulling to
effectively "cancel the glare" of the central star, allowing otherwise-
invisible, close-orbiting objects to be seen.   That's right, folks, TPF
is a visual technique -- there will be an image, even if it's just a
moving pinprick.

But hey, why stop there?  Once we've gotten that far (IF we ever get that
far... sigh...), let's build an even bigger interferometer so that the
images of terrestrial planets subtend several pixels on our imaging
system.  That's the Planetary Imager.  This is the one that they've
proposed sending out to 5 AU -- to get away from inner solar-system dust
and infrared radiation.

   I used to write code like that - I prefered simulation solar system
accretion (using only a 100 bodies or so - *not* realistic, but a lot of
fun to watch) and motion of objects near L4 & L5. You could do worse to
turn kids on to science by letting them "play" with programs like this.
Be warned that Accrete doesn't do any animations, and the central model
is not dynamical, so you can't "see" it happening, but it's still neat.
One version of it (Starform) goes much further with climate
calculations...

   Agreed with both of you (sorry for combining posts, but it seemed
appropriate), but these negative results rarely get the same press
covereage (interpreted as "I didn't know about them" <grin>). It is
curious that the two of you seem to present very different limits, one
that only 30% of stars have close-in jovians, and the other that "only
5% have [proven] planets". Does anyone have any references for these
negative results calculations? This is perhaps where pressing the
detection limits might yield the biggest pay-offs - some models indicate
that the solar system without Jupiter would be a *very* different place,
for instance.

Yeah, that's one of my main resources for various programs and such.  A
wonderful site.  I just have to take the time and track down, from
there, what is offered.  If I recall right, there are old accrete
programs, and more modern variations, such as It's Full of Stars,
although many of these newer programs are not... well, very accurate
even in a passing sense.  But they are still fun to play around with!

They're limits of two different things.

Bruce's stat is that about 5% of stars (surveyed) have
easily-detectable planets (high gravitational influence on their star;
tend to be hot Jupiters) and about 95% (again, surveyed) don't.

Mine (reference below) is really two: no more than about 30% (and it
may be much less -- there is no lower limit save 0; again the caveat
"of those surveyed" applies) of stars have Jupiter-mass planets
orbiting from 1.5 to 3 AU away, and no more than about 30% (same
caveats) have planets of about 3 M_j from 1 to 4 AU out.

The negative result Bruce mentions would leave open the possibility
that 3-M_j planets 4AU out are quite common. The one I cited would
leave open the possibility that hot Jupiters are quite common.

Taking the results together, we can say that (if the stars surveyed
can be thought of as typical)

Stars with hot Jupiters or hot Saturns: 5%
Stars with planets > ~1 M_j from 1-3 AU: <30% (probably much less,
 like 2%, as this gets into the range of Doppler detections).
Stars with planets > ~3 M_j from 1 to 4 AU: <30% (possibly near zero).

      by deduction

Stars with no > Jupiter-mass planets within 4 AU: 65%-95%.

Stars with no terrestrial planets in the habitable zone: 3%-100%
(doesn't say much, but the close-in giant planets in elliptical orbits
rule out terrestrial planets there; they could, however, have
habitable satellites around giant planets).

The two are not contradictory... they are just different limits based on
different surveys.


Microlensing is the only technique likely, within the next 5 years, to
constrain the frequency of Jupiter-analogs. The PLANET collaboration
has monitored nearly 100 microlensing events of which more than 20 have
sensitivity to the perturbations that would be caused by a Jovian-mass
companion to the primary lens. No clear signatures of such planets have
been detected. These null results indicate that Jupiter mass planets with
separations of 1.5-3 AU occur in less than 1/3 of systems. A similar limit
applies to planets of 3 Jupiter masses between 1-4 AU.
http://xxx.lpthe.jussieu.fr/abs/astro-ph/0004269 <http://xxx.lpthe.jussieu.fr/abs/astro-ph/0004269>

Bottom line: Approximately 3% of Solar Type stars harbor planetary
companions that have masses from 1 - 10 Mjup and orbit within a several
Astronomical Units (AU). At most 1% of stars harbor brown-dwarf
companions within several AU. Their masses are spread out from 10 - 70
Mjup, as demonstrated beautifully by the data of Michel Mayor, Antoine
Duquennoy, and Didier Queloz at Geneva Observatory and Observatoire
de Haute Provence.

http://cannon.sfsu.edu/~gmarcy/planetsearch/bd/bd.html <http://cannon.sfsu.edu/~gmarcy/planetsearch/bd/bd.html>

Note that the Marcy and Butler paper is a little old and far more planets
have been detected since, and the last statistic I saw said now it was about
5% of surveyed stars.  Also note that almost all surveyed stars are "Solar
Type" stars whereas the Microlensing event constrains companions to all
stars, and would include Brown Dwarfs.

I've seen a more recent paper that described the frequency of discovery
at various detection limits but I don't have a reference.

Well, maybe it's just whistling in the dark, but I think that the low
number of Jupiter sized planets in the "prime real estate" region of
sun-like stars is good news. The microlensing paper doesn't really address
systems like ours, with Jupiter sized planets beyond 4AU. 

If planetary systems start by having large Jupiter classed planets
spiraling into the primary, it's also possible that there are quite a few
systems with no large Jupiter mass gas giants - maybe only Saturn sized or
smaller.

The problems with all of these surveys is that they investigate only a
few systems (most stars fail for a number of reasons, amongst them
are: length of observation, location of the star relative to others
and many other reasons) have really been checked and the results give
only a few datapoints on a large range of the variability.  Doing
lensing checks on stars is quite problematic as the planets don't
necessarially produce a huge lensing effect and then only when the
planet passes directly in front of the star in question which has
problems as the parent sun is so close to the star at that range.
Next is to find stars with a sufficient number of stars behind so that
the lensing effect can be seen in a decent time interval.  The process
can detect planets but the restrictions on the process can't tell you
how many systems are really out there because the sample compared to
the rest of the stars is so small and the probability of the detection
is also so small as to make the results pretty meaningless.

Yes, that's why the surveys always couch the probabilities in the
appropriate terms:  X chance of mass A-B at distance C-D, etc.

Actually, all of those possible errors are *included* in the calculation;
that's why the estimate from lensing was so high.  100 or so samples
out of millions really can be statistically signficant, at least for our own
neck of the woods.

   One interesting point: has anyone targeted any double stars? In
short, when limits like "5% of surveyed stars" are stated, is that
generally 5% of solitary stars? this reduces the "odds" considerably
(and there would seem to be no *technical* reason why doppler searches
couldn't reveal planets around binaries as well, although "external"
planets would likely be tough due to long orbital periods).

good "correction" for these limits in terms of *all* stars (not just
solitary ones)?

One planet has been discovered orbiting binary stars:

http://physicsweb.org/article/news/03/11/4 <http://physicsweb.org/article/news/03/11/4>

It sounds like this is one planet orbiting around both stars (?);
there could also be systems with a planet orbiting one star, but with
another star farther away orbiting the star-planet(s) system.

I think searches have mainly targeted single-star systems because the
results are easier to comprehend.

Most stars are double or greater star systems.  There might have been
some selection bias away from multiple star systems, but I think now all
Sol-type and other close stars are being surveyed.

We've found several planets orbiting in multiple star star systems.
Aside from the link posted by John (I think that's about the planet that
is believed to orbit both stars), we have the planet around Tau Bootis,
aka GJ 527A, which has a companion star GJ 527B, the planet around
55 Cancri, aka rho Cancri A, which has companion star rho Cancri B,
the planet around Gl 86 (probably a binary system), and the planet around
16 Cygni B --16 Cygni A and C also exist, making it a trinary system.
There are probably others too.
