TITLE: Universe Simulation Alogrithms 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi,
     I am looking for many alogrithms that are related to universe generation
for simulation or virtual reality. Many years ago, I found them somewhere
within Internet. Today they were gone completely. I tried to archie them 
but no luck. I have a listing of needed alogrithms:

      Acrete alogrithm - star system development - binary, solar system
                         with different colors of star. Also planet
                         development. That is using physic laws.
      Landscape - land development with cayons, rivers, lakes, etc.
                  with plantic movement, etc.. 
      Climate - development from tundra to tropical with weathers, etc.
      Vegatation and Animals - development for plants, etc..
      Resources - minerals, etc.

      That is my idea for the great universe adventure game like Star Trek, etc.
I need complete listings to do research. :) Or which newsrgroups are the best
for that?

      If so, I will appericate that. Thanks you!!
