TITLE: Accrete and Actual

I am looking for the source code for a program called Accrete. It
simulates the creation of planetary system through accretion.  I heard
that it was part of a suite of programs involved in something called
the Actual hoax a few months ago.  I am looking for any FTP location
where this program or any other similiar simulators and/or generators
are archived.  I also heard that the Actual programs were archived on
simtel20, but I searched there and couldn't find them.

Let me know if you find any.  The "actual" hoax was in 1988, a little longer
than a few months ago.  For a long time, the Universal Simulation Mailing
List, which sprang from the Actual hoax and inspired the posting of Accrete,
was archived on topgun.agps.lanl.gov <http://topgun.agps.lanl.gov> [192.12.184.4] pub/usml but has been
gone for a while.

I don't have any of that stuff on line anymore, but it was a very interesting
year of discussion.

You might be interested in something I wrote at that time:  here's a quote
from the README.

You can get it from anyplace that archives comp.sources.misc, volume 18.
My favorite place is to ftp from ftp.uu.net <http://ftp.uu.net>, directory
usenet/comp.sources.misc/volume18/planet.
