TITLE: Solar System Acretion Models 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tuesday, 17 August 1993 10:00:00 UTC+1 - David M. Swain:
I am looking for a solar system builder ( sounds gandiose doesn't it ). But
I understand that there is a basic program called ACRETE that evolves a 
system from a number of planetesimals. Does anyone know where I can obtain a copy
of this ( with source code if possible ) or conversely any other program
which performs a similar function and runs on a PC or has the source code
so that I can recompile/modify it accordingly.
Thanks a million

David M. Swain
