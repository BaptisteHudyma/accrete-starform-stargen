TITLE: Universe Simulator - GOT IT! NEED ARCHIVE SITE 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Monday, 20 September 1993 20:08:26 UTC+1 - Ralph Wirthlin:
A few years ago someone started a hoax about a universe simulator game
called  "Actual".  This hoax eventually led to a mailing list and while
no game was developed, an awful lot of good ideas and code floated around
and was eventually dumped to an archive site.  This site disappeared for a
few years and reappeared suddenly a few months back for a period of a few
days.  I ftp'd everything from the USML directory to my local account.
The site reappeared just this past week but with a purged disk.  
  I've almost lost the collection twice and would really like to place it
in a more permanent collection where everyone could benefit from it.
The collection totals just over 3.1 MB, so I don't think it would strain
too many resources.

Could you give some more info about what the game actually does?
It sounds quite interesting...

Cool!  I tried that site a few times, but never got any response.  I believe
the archives contain several programs, and several discussion logs.  I am
not sure what to do with the logs, but you could certainly post the programs
on comp.sources.misc.  I have posted newer versions of a couple of the
items there (plate tectonics and climate generation) on that newsgroup.
It is certainly archived in many places and available to archie.

Like I mentioned, an actual game was not developed, however I'm including
the readme file from the archives below to give you a flavor of what's in
the archive.  Please *note* that the mailing list and archive site no
longer exist and that the reference to Empire is incorrect (it is *not* in
the archive).

For those of you in this discussion who have an interest in
applying what you know about fractal generation to the
field of world/universe modeling, i would like to let you
know about another mailing list which has just recently
started. The Universe Simulation Mailing List is a
departure from a clever hoax that caught more than a few
interested eyes on a couple of Usenet news groups. The
discussion is centered around the development of software
designed specifically to model or simulate just about any
aspect of the universe that you might care to consider. the
diversity of interest range from Big Bang simulators to
random planet and star generators to topography, weather,
etc... modeling to culture simulation to .... Well, you get
the picture. What holds all these diverse levels of
interest together is a common goal to design and develop
usable model generators and simulators that will all relate
to each other. We hope to create a situation where someone
can take the ouput from a planet generator, for example,
and use the information as input to a planetary weather
simulator or topography generator.

So, if anyone here is interested in that sort of thing, you
can contact the moderator for this mailing list at the
following address:

    Internet:    sie...@hc.dspo.gov <>

Send to us...@hc.dspo.gov <> to broadcast your message to the entire
mailing list.  Send to usml-r...@hc.dspo.gov <> to have your name added
or dropped from the list.  FTP to hc.dspo.gov <http://hc.dspo.gov> (or dspo.dspo.gov <http://dspo.dspo.gov> or
192.12.184.4) to get archives and source code.

Actual.  A log containing some information on "Actual".
OtherSun.src by Sean Malloy. A program to generate a "hex" containing
  about 1000 stars and generate planets for the stars using the Other
  Suns SFRPG rules.  Written in C.
Psychohistory.  A log containing a long discussion on various newsgroups
  about psychohistory.
accrete.c and accretion.src, by Matt Burdick.  A program incorporating
  many astrophysical formulae to generate stars and planets by accretion.
  Matt has done a lot of research in journals to come up with the
  relationships; the program is very complete.  Accrete.c is in C
  while accretion.src is the same thing in Turbo Pascal.
empire.0.9.2:
  The current version of empire from Berkeley.
fractal.c, by Ed King.  A program to generate rectangular pieces of terrain
  using a fractal algorithm.
plates.c, A program to implement a set of plate tectonic algorithms by
  Mark Isaak
references, by Jim Meritt.  Contains about a hundred journal references
  in every branch of science related to simulation of natural
  phenomena.
shebs, by Stan Shebs.  A 13-page document describing a philosophy for
  simulation of a universe once it is created.
siod.c, sources to siod (scheme in one defun).  siod is a subset 
  of scheme written in C by George Carrette (g...@bu-it.bu.edu <>)
system.arc, by Andy Sheppard.  A program to generate star systems and
  planets using rules from Future Law / Tech Law and GURPS Space, plus
  a lot of Andy's own research and ideas.  Written in C.
traveller.src, from comp.sources.games in 1987.  A complete program,
  written in C, that generates a sector using all the rules from Traveller
  Book 6, Scouts. 
xc5.1-tar.Z - Current version of Xconq written by Stan Shebs.

Volume1:  Contains the archives of conversations up to Sept 22, 1988.
          This is when I standardized my digest format... Also includes
          stuff from moderator before me.
starform:
  This program is based on an article by Martyn Fogg in the Journal of the
  British Interplanetary Society (JBIS) called 'Extrasolar Planetary Systems:
  a Microcomputer Simulation'.  In it, he described how to generate various
  sun-like solar systems randomly.

Just so everyone knows, I have uploaded the archive to wuarchive.wustl.edu <http://wuarchive.wustl.edu>
in the directory pub/usml.

Yes, it was there and was promptly deleted as I was in the middle of
downloading.... Please Upload again to /pub/MSDOS_UPLOADS, at least files
beginning with m-z!
                                Thanks,

[stuff deleted]
Hi,

       I downloaded everything from USML archive site when I was in my
college life several years ago. I left the Internet world when I graduated
from Gallaudet University. A few years later, I re-enter the internet world
when I found the internet-based public unix access site in DC area and
moved to the internet-based Clarknet system as my administrative position.
I will stay here for a rest of my life at the internet world. :)

       I will upload USML stuffs to here and put them on my newly anonymous
ftp site that was created by me for everyone around the world. Stay on tune..

Maybe we should start up the universe simulator list and things again? I'd
like to have a bunch of progs to do what the usml stuff was going to do, but
the usml stuff in the archive doesn't have a lot of stuff in it, and could be
built on.

So what do you folks say? Anyone willing to start a mailing list &/or ftp site?
(I can't from this acct.)

This kind of stuff is useful for among other things, automatic generation of
virtual worlds for VR (one of my hobby horses).
