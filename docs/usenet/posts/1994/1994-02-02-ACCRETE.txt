TITLE: ACCRETE 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wednesday, 2 February 1994 02:36:39 UTC - Brent Josep Lehman:
Does anyone have the program ACCRETE in Turbo Pascal 7.0 code, or something
compatible enough to run in Turbo Pascal 7.0, or something already
executable on a PC?  I've seen the thing about four times in C and just
can't seem to get the thing to port anywhere.  If I have to, I'll learn
C, or write the thing myself in Pascal, but I want to explore all avenues
before resorting to that.  It seems everyone has it but me! <sniff>
Thanks much to anyone who can help,

P.S. Or something executable on a Unix-based system? or executable on a Mac?
or on an Amiga? or an Atari 5200? or an HP Calculator? (Not necessarily in
that order)

What is this ACCRETE program?
