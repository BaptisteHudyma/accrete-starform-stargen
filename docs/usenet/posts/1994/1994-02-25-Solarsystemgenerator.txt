TITLE: Solar system generator?

Howdy,
A while back I came across a unix program that generated random solar
systems.  Alas, I managed to stupidly erase it from my account and
cannot recall where to find it.  I believe the name was something like
"system" or "stellar" or maybe "accrete".

Anyone out there know anything of the sort?

Thanx, 

- DM

Sure do.   The program was originally called accrete and was written
up in some journals.  I basically simualted the formation of the
planets by accretion of dust and gas.  Gave fairly "realistic"
results.  Someone ported it to C and added some other features that
determined the climate and some other attributes.  This was either
called starform or system.  

I have a copy somewhere around here (I hope it didn't get fried in the
hard disk crash).  I have been trying to update and reorganize the
code and port it to Windows.  If you desire, I could try and mail it
to you.  There is also a mailing list (universe) that deals with this
subject.  Send mail to universe...@news.clark.net <> or
list...@news.clark.net <>.  There is also an associated ftp site,
ftp.clark.net <http://ftp.clark.net>.  Good hunting.
