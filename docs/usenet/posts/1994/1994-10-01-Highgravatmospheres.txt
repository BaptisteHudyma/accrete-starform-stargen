Perhaps you mean air pressure, rather than air density? The weight of a column
of air over a square foot gives a pressure, not a density. There is a *big*
difference, but both could be useful in inventing an alien life form. Please
clarify.

I think I remember that atmospheric pressure scales linearly with
gravity from the rules for creating planets in the roleplaying game
2300 AD. Since this game is very hard sf (at least when it comes to
physics), I think it is reasonable. I also vaguely remember from
reading the source-code to ACCRETE or something similar that a 
roughly linear formula was used to calculate surface pressure.

When it comes to density the case is more complex. 2300 AD uses the
measure MMW, Minimum Retained Molecular Weight, to calculate which
gasses will remain in the atmosphere. This depends on gravity and
also on temperature, but determines the density of the atmosphere. 
Maybe somebody has the formula?

This depends on is you change the net mass of the atmosphere at the same
time you change the mass of the planet. Lets assume your planet has the
same density as the Earth, but twice the mass. To find g of your planet
you first need the radius. Let rho be the density. 
        rho = M_earth / ( (4/3) Pi R_earth^3)

        M_planet = 2 M_earth = rho V_planet = rho (4/3) Pi R_planet^3

                 = M_earth ( R_planet/ R_earth )^3

        R_earth * (M_planet/M_earth)^(1/3) = R_planet

        R_planet = 2^(1/3) R_earth

Okay, so now we get g_planet

        g_planet = G M_planet / (R_planet^2)

                 = 2 G M_earth / ( 2^(2/3) R_earth^2)

                 = 2^(1/3) g_earth

The pressure at the surface must supply enough force to support the
atmosphere above it. If we assume that almost all of the atmosphere is
very close to the surface of the planet (this is true in the case of the
Earth) then this force must be

        F = M_total_atmosphere g_planet

          = P_planet * A

Where A is the surface area of the planet, A = 4 Pi R_planet^2, so

        M_total_atmosphere g_planet = P_planet * 4 Pi R_planet^2 

and        P_planet = M_total_atmosphere g_earth / (4 Pi 2^(1/3) R_earth^2)

where one of the 2^(1/3)'s have canceled. I'm not sure how one should go
about getting M_total_atmosphere.  You may be able to get it by playing around
with the law of atmospheres and ideal gas stuff, but I need to go do 
something constructive. I don't know how accurate this would be anyway-
I think what M_total_atmosphere turns out to be depends on a lot of other
stuff (such has the temperation, both current and past, of the planet) that
is really uncertain. I'm pretty sure you could put an upper bound on it, but
I see no reason why a even a very large planet need have much of an atmosphere
at all, if something happened to it.

2300 AD is not really all that accurate with even simple physics. Somewhere 
early in the Aurore Sourcebook they have the boiling point of water increasing 
with decreased pressure (and this is not just a typo). If they can make 
mistakes like that then I wouldn`t trust them with anything more complicated.

On the subject of atmospheric pressure variation with gravity, it is not going 
to be a simple law. After all Venus and the Earth have fairly similar masses, 
but Venus has much higher atmospheric pressure.

Of course I did not suggest to use the game as a physics book, but the
planetary creation rules seems to give rather good results with a minimum
of trouble, and doesn't look that wrong. But I agree, there are many bugs
elsewhere in the game (just look at the economics!).

Venus has similar size and surface gravity to Earth,
but the atmosphere is much denser, because there's simply more of it.
A planet's gravity determines how squashed at the bottom of the gravity well
the air is, and whether/how fast it will leak into space,
but the pressure-per-square-inch is the total weight of
air above one square inch.  (That's not quite local g times the
total mass, as g decreases as you go up, but except for really
thick atmospheres like Jupiter, forget that.)
So the big factors are how much gas the planet has collected,
from collisions with frozen gas comets, outgassing by volcanoes,
bacteria turning solids/liquids into molecules small enough to
be gas (or the reverse switch), and how much it has lost by
condensation and leakage into space.  For an Earth size planet
you can assume that hydrogen and helium have wandered off,
unless you have a continuing or recent input, but for other gases...
you need to model the planetology and ecology in some detail.
(No oxygen, probably, without life to barf it into the air
all the time.)

BTW, your 1.5 to 2 times Earth gravity doesn't determine escape
velocity, which is what fixes leakage rates.  A tiny dense planet
can have strong surface gravity which diminishes much faster per
kilometer upward than for a big low density planet of the same mass,
so it will lose air much faster.
