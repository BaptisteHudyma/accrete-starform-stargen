TITLE: Seeking info on protostellar nebulae & protoplanetary accretion disks

Hi, I got this program ACCRETE which simulates the formation of planets in
accretion disks.  It uses a number of parameters concerning the initial
conditions in the accretion disks, and changes in these parameters can
greatly affect the resulting system's morphology.
     - It uses the equation, rho=A*e^(-a*r^(1/3)) where rho is the
        density, e is the natural logarithmic constant, A and a are
        other constants, and r is distance from the star.  As you can
        see, A acts a scaling coefficient, and a determines the amount
        of "dropoff" of density as r increases; i.e., how quickly rho
        approaches 0 as r approaches infinity.  Oh, yeah.  Density of
        what, you may ask?  Density of the gas/dust mixture in the
        disk.  The program produces solar systems like our own when
        A is .0015 to .002 and a is 5.  Can anyone suggest what values
        A and a may take on in disks around other types of stars, say
        type M or F, relative to Sol?

    - It also uses a constant K, which is the gas/dust ratio in the
        disk. Stephen Dole and Carl Sagan seem to agree that the value
        for our star was about 50.  Can anyone tell me what K might for
        other types of stars?

    - The orbital eccentricity of the particles in the disk is also
        taken in
        (oops) taken into account.  Sagan says the value for our star
        may have been about 0.2, and the program produces Sol-like
        solar systems for this value.  Might this value change with
        different types of stars?  How?

    - The program randomly generates eccentricities for the planetesimals
        it generates using the equation, 1-(1-Y)^0.077.  I don't know
        why it doesn't use 1-Y^0.077, which is mathematically equivalent,
        but anyway, Y is a random number between 0 and 1.  This equation
        produces a frequency distribution which seems to match our own
        solar system.  Would that number 0.077 change with other types
        of stars? How?

      Oops, 1-Y^0.077 produces the same range of values with the same
        frequency distribution. That's what I meant to say.

The program, as it stands, doens

(oops) doesn't consider these variables.  I would really like to consider
them to see what other morpholgies come about when you enter in data that
reflects a different kind of star.  Can anyone help or direct me?
