I can do better than that... there already EXISTS an FTP site which
has that program, and many other related ones.  Look there; there's a
lot of good stuff.

The site is topgun.agps.lanl.gov <http://topgun.agps.lanl.gov> (192.12.184.4).  I don't really know
where it is, or who owns it; I do not own it, and I have no authority over
it.  Here is the contents of pub/usml:

Actual                  accrete.c               shebs
Archive                 accretion.amiga         siod.c
Digests                 accretion.src           starcul.shar
List                    archive                 starform
OtherSun.src            cellsim_1.5.tar.Z       system.arc
Psychohistory           fractal.c               traveller.tar
README                  plates.c                xc5.1-tar.Z
Universe                references

The program Nicolai is describing, I believe, is accrete.c.  Both Sean and
I wrote some of the files in that archive, about two years ago.

Good luck!
