I've been playing with a package in C that came from someone off of
the usenet (I believe) that is a microcomputer implementation
with modifications of Stephen Dole's ACCRETE program.  If I
recall correctly, I got my copy from Sean
Malloy (@nprdc ?).
Sean, are you out there?  Maybe you could make that UNIVERSE
program available for ftp somehow?  (I don't think people could
get it from me on FidoNet very easily.)

In theory, this is a reasonably scientifically accurate simulation
of planetary accretion dynamics.  It will produce a star system
in roughly 15 seconds on a 20 MHz 386 (with no math coprocessor)
when compiled under Borland's Turbo C version 2.0 optimized for
speed.  Worth looking at, IMNSHO.

There was a mailing list a couple years back about universe
simulation, which included a bunch of programs for various purposes.
The ACCRETE program or one of its variants was one of them.  I still
have copies of some of the programs.  If someone wants to set up an
FTP site (I can't, for company policy reasons), I'd be happy to pass
them on.

Before a million people ask for copies -- no, I won't mail them to
individuals.  I already have enough trouble trying to keep up with
GURPS Digest add requests without taking on any more hopeless tasks.
