TITLE: Stellar formation models 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Friday, 8 November 1991 03:40:03 UTC - Peter Cooper:
I'm currently looking for a stellar formation model for use in a game
I've been thinking about writing for some time.
I did a citation search, and wasn't able to find very much with any sort
of 'meat' -- more like articles explaining anomalies with the T-Tauri
stars.  I was hoping that someone could point me towards a good article
or three on current theory and models.  (I've read the 1969 article by
S. Dole in _Icarus_, and found it really useful, and have developed a
planetary accretion simulator based on his work -- surely there's
something as approachable in the current literature?)

Thanks

Peter

I'm afraid that I can't really help much; although I did a good bit of
my own research for a star-system generator for a science-fiction
game.  My best resource happened to be a friendly Astronomy Ph.D.

What exactly are you trying to model?  I can give you pointers to
books that will tell you a little about star formation, stellar
densities, and stellar types.  As far as planetary systems go, to
quote Dr Dean "you can draw almost any curve through one data point".

I didn't worry too much about the mechanics of planetary formation,
but assumed that *MOST* stars had a planetary system similar to our
own (planets get smaller towards the inner and outer edges; gas giants
in the outer system, mudballs in the inner system, asteriod belts in
between).

I have a copy of a planetary system generator originally written by Matt
Burdick from an article by Martyn Fogg.  I implemented a fairly simplistic
star generator for it, but I wouldn't mind having more information about
star formation for it.  Also, if anyone wants a copy of the code, I'd be glad
to try to get it out to them.

A few months ago, I added code for determining initial star type based
on realistic stellar distributions.  That is, most stars are class M
main-sequence stars.  It also generates multiple-star systems.
Unfortunately, due to a disk accident I lost my latest revision, but I
should have the code back up to where it was previously by next week
sometime.  If anyone is interested, send me mail at:

    bur...@hpspd.spd.hp.com <>

I don't want anyone making money off it (except me, of course :-), so
it's copyrighted but freely available.  I hope to test it on PC's, HP
workstations, Sun workstations, and Ultrix before I send it out.  If
anyone has other machines they'd like to test it on, I'll send them an
early copy and they can try it out.
