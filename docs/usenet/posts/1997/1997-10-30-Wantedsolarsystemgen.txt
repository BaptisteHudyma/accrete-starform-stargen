TITLE: Wanted: solar system generator 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thursday, 30 October 1997 08:00:00 UTC - Antti Arola:
Anyone know a ftp/www site where I could get a (preferably 2300AD-based)
computer program that would generate solar systems for me? I could make
one myself but don't like wasting time on another sideproject...
Preferably either PC executable or source code in TP/C/C++.

Thanks in advance,

Go out to my page, go to the Traveller page, and you find two versions of Accrete as well as a link to the Accret home page.  URL below.

Is that scale anywhere even close to sensible anymore? Let's assume a 10k
file for one solar system and 200E+09 solar systems in a galaxy - that
would make a 2000 terabyte file, which I would have some serious trouble
fitting to my hard drive with. ;-)

Even the result of _my_ system-generation project (estimated 15 megs)
looks scary enough, especially when it's supposed to be a supplement for
a 200kB RPG... <grin>

Sounds like a good complement for Accret (which is just what I was looking
for) and an interesting tool to play with. Probably will eliminate the
need of finding out the meaning of those UWP (or something like that)
strings.

I'll do that, thanks for the info.

<Whew> What a relief. :-) But, because I didn't find any demo version
download links at the page, I think I'll just do away with Accrete,
Gliese3 and some other stuff I grabbed from a starmapping site found by
following the links at Logicrucible.

Sorry, for some reason I think I missed this post before, and I don't
think I've previously replied.

There's one on my web page; World Generator, a program for PC which was
shareware and is now freeware, with Turbo Pascal 4 source code. Not very
realistic, but for various reasons I never got round to improving it. It
is a very simple-minded program but does have the advantage of being
VERY fast on modern machines. It generates systems in a 10x10x10 LY
space, draws planet maps, calculates travel distances etc., so could
work quite well for 2300 AD.

Unfortunately it runs in the old CGA 4-colour (320x200) mode and various
aspects of the way it works make it more or less impossible to upgrade
it to a better palette or resolution. It'd probably be easier to write a
new program from scratch.

If what you are after is raw system data, Accrete works better.

There's one for GURPS at http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/utilities/ <http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/utilities/>
but you should have little trouble in using it for 2300AD.

Antti,

I hope you have better luck than I did in finding the downloadedable demo.
