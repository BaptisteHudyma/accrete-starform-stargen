   Well, speed-of-light limitation is a good place to start. Earth radius
is 6378 km, meaning travel time for a photon across it (can't get much
faster than that, if we want to leave *any* conventional physics intact)
would be about 0.04 seconds - near enough to instantaneous to the eye.
   Real shockwaves in rock travel at much lower speeds, generally only km
per second. Assuming a really hypervelocity shock (say 1000 km/sec, very
unrealistic), it would take almost 13 seconds for the effect of the beam
to be felt on the far side of the planet - certainly *not* instant
destruction.
   So, probably wouldn't happen. Not too much of a suprise.
   As for the energy, let's underestimate it. How much energy would it
take to seperate the Earth into 2 pieces, with both drifting away from
each other, never to be seen again? I get around 9.3 * 10^31 J (using the
potential energy of two masses, each 1/2 an Earth mass, seperated by 1
Earth radius - a rough estimate), or about 2.2 * 10^16 Mt. Still too big a
number? Using E=mc^2, that's 10^15 kg (a chunk of rock about 7 km on a
side). Another way to put it is that it's about 1/10 of the annual output
of the Sun. Not bad, for a station only the size of a moon ;-).
   OK, so it's a little unrealistic there too. Oh well. The model was
probably slightly easier to detonate.

How about some technical analysis from those of you who are more
mathematically literate than myself.
What kind of energy would it take to make a planet explode in a matter
of seconds, if it is even possible? Assume that the planet is like
Earth if it will make your calculations easier.

Forget it. Star Wars is really a fairy tale set in space. It's hugely
entertaining, but it doesn't make the slightest pretence at scientific
literacy. The reason why no-one picks on it here is because of that
lack of pretence. Star Trek, OTOH, tries very hard to sound like it's
using real science, but it's conning the audience, which is why it is
routinely pilloried for its science on this newsgroup.

Don't forget clark's law <G>.

In any event, what about a stream of Antimatter directed at the Planet?  It
could tear a hole through the planet through mutual destruction and shock
waves, and then the later beam could have a higher density or a 3Km
'pellet' that would be inserted inside the center.  

Bet it would be impressive.

How do you Nova a star?  How about a large Stasis field inserted into the

According to Sean Barrett, the amount of energy to completely disrupt
a uniform spherical body is:

E = 0.6G(M^2)/R

where:
E = energy in joules
G = Newton's gravitational constant = 6.673 x 10^-11 N (m^2)/(kg^2)
M = mass of the planet in kilograms
R = radius of the planet in meters
x^2 = square of x

Example: Earth's mass is 5.974 x 10^24 kgs, radius is 6,378,000 
meters.
E = 2.24 x 10^32 joules, which is about the energy 
in 2.73 million million tons of matter/antimatter mix.

That's a *lot* of energy.

This is based on the calculation of how much energy would be
required to move each atom from the earth's gravitional field
to infinity.

Note that the energy must be efficiently applied, simply
bombarding the surface with millions of teratons of nuclear
devices wouldn't work. (it would churn the entire planet,
but that's not what the Death Star did).

#+nitpick
The answer, assuming uniform density, is something like 2.2 * 10^32 J;
the formula is
 (3 * M^2 * G) / (5 * R)
or
 3 * M * g * R / 5
IIRC where G is Newton's constant and g is the gravity at the planet's
surface.  (It's much too early in the morning for me to get these
things exactly right, but someone will correct me, I have no doubt).
Since the Earth is not uniformly dense, I'd expect the true number to
be a little higher.

        About a week's output for the Sun. One wonders how
they handled the waste heat in an object the size of a moon:
If it'll dust an Earth sized planet, even 1% leakage should
toast the DS easily. There were not huge radiators, so either
the process is very very efficient or the energy production
is inside the target, not the DS.

        If it were a Greg Bear story, the DS would work by flipping
the dipswitches on the laws of nature, so gravity turned off for a moment
and angular momentum ripped the planet apart (This does not match what
we saw). If it were a Future History story, it would exploit that
loophole in CoE that slipstick Libby found. For Banks, it is clearly
gridfire.

So that's the weak spot Luke Skywalker hit! It was the heat disposal
system. Suddenly the Death Star had yottajoules of energy with nowhere
to go. Kaboom! :-)

And if it was Star Trek, the femtocrystals would destabilise causing a
quasi-eon flux in the fabric of space-time.

The amount of energy required to completely gravitationally disrupt a body
-- that is, give each little bit of mass escape velocity from every other
little bit of mass -- is called the gravitational binding energy, and for a
uniform, spherical mass, is 

    U = (3/5) G M^2/R.

With the assumption that the Earth is uniform (incorrect, but sufficient to
get an order-of-magnitude estimate), with M = 5.97 x 10^24 kg and R = 6.37
x 10^6 m, U is 2.24 x 10^32 J.  By comparison, the Sun's luminosity is
about 4 x 10^26 W; the gravitational binding energy of the Earth is equal
to about a week of the Sun's total energy output.

Now to make it happen in "a matter of seconds" you need to apply even more
energy.  The only real limitation there is the speed of light.  (Any waves
travelling through the body itself are going to be shockwaves, not sound
waves.)

Why bother even trying to destroy a whole planet in the first place, when
you can just destroy the surface or just the biosphere.  It can be done

As long as you have a _lot_ of nukes.  A global thermonuclear war would
collapse human civilization, but the biosphere would certainly survive.  It
wouldn't even be comparable to mass extinctions in the past which have
happened naturally.

If I could control the star's gravity, I'd increase it a hundredfold for
a second (or less).  Suddenly you'd have a lot more mass fusing in the
core than you would ordinarily...

The effect would depend on how much energy is released in the manuever. 
(WARNING: although I have studied physics for a couple of years, I am
not  an expert.  Astrophysicists are welcome to criticize)  Not enough
extra mass and you get increased flare activity; too much and you get a
supernova, effectively destroying the star (while a nova would leave the
star intact...)

On a military perspective, increased flare activity could toast ships
near the star in question or (if the flares are large enough), fry
sections of close planets; however, you'd have to hope that the enemy
was located were the flare hit ;)

A supernova would blast everything in the system, and _might_ leave one
or two planets shriveled but intact, if they were far enough away.  But
with the star destroyed, you would not be able to settle them once the
lava cooled...

Best bet is a nova; the planets are left intact, and the outer planets
may even be unscathed.  Any colonies, homeworlds, and ships within a
certain radius would be destroyed; ships and nonselfsufficient colonies
would then be cut off from resupply and could be starved out or blown up
at leasure.  And if you waited a few centuries, the radiation on the
inner planets would die down enough to resettle (you'd need to terraform
the planets, though).

This is true.  It would result in increased mass ejection after a period of
about a million years, but other than that it wouldn't amount to much.

Increased flare activity, yes.  Periods of mass ejection, perhaps.  But
supernova, no.  A supernova occurs when a depleted iron core collapses to
form a neutron star; the neutron star's rebound after its formation (after
it reaches "maximum scrunch," if it's not black-hole-progenitor mass it
rebonds) forces the already infalling envelope to erupt outward.

You won't get a supernova without this neutron star formation, and for that
you need a massive supergiant, which has fused the nuclear fuel in its core
to fulfillment, so you have (essentially) nothing left to fuse but Fe.

And about the delay:  It takes on the order of a million years (give or
take a factor of ten) for a photon generated by fusion in the Sun's core to
escape through the random walk to the surface and be seen outside the star. 
Strange, but true.

There has been some recent specualtion that mass extinctions might be
caused by nearby (ie within 20-30 ly iirc) novas irradiating the solar
system with neutrinos. You might find your nova-bomb is more
destructive than you think, including damage to neighboring star
systems.

Thanks a lot, it's great to talk to an expert.  But since flare activity
would be the only real benefit, then it makes tinkering with stars a
poor option from a military standpoint. >sigh<

I'd also like to extend thanks to Chris Lawson for talking about the
_magnitude_ of novas, to the point of damaging nearby systems (or at
least their ecologies).  Of course, if one had FTL travel (the only
thing which would make interstellar war feasable), and the right
technology, one could protect the extra planets from "post-war" damage
when the radiation comes flying by two to twenty years later...

And also in PROTECTOR, where interstellar war is made possible by the
long lifetimes of the Protectors and by their ability to tolerate
mind-numbing environments for thousands of years.

   While this is true, it may or may not have a bearing on your original
point about time delays. Shock propagation can far exceed thermal
diffusion of photons out of the core. This is certainly true for a
supernova; the neutrinos are followed only a short time later (ms to min?
Certainly not years) by the optical image of the star exploding. What
about for a more conventional nova? Are those shock-driven, or only
thermally driven?

You're a very polite poster. Who invited you here? :-)

Anyway, thanks for the recognition, but I obviously didn;t quite get
my message across. The problem isn't the magnitude of novas per se -
no-one's gonna get fried from the normal EM radiation from a nova
unless they're *very* close. What I was describing was the postulated
neutrino bombardment of nearby worlds. Traditionally neutrinos have
been ignored as a radiation source because they interact so weakly
with normal matter that no-one thought they could possibly be as
damaging as, say,  X-rays.

However, some theorists have postulated that neutrino radiation from
nearby novas makes up for this weak interaction by sheer weight of
numbers, ie there are so *many* neutrinos, that they still cause  a
significant radiation load, thus triggering a mass extinction.

This is a loooong way from a widely-accepted explanation of mass
exctinctions. I merely raised it as a possible problem with detonating
enemy stars - it may well sterilise your own nearby systems.

And BTW, having FTL travel is no help in itself - what you really need
is some form of planetary shielding against neutrinos. I think the
term for this is "unobtainium", and you can see a perfect example of
unobtainium being used for the specific purpose of neutrino shielding
in Niven's RINGWORLD.

regards,
Chris

This is for supernovae, not novae.  Novae will create neutrinos, sure --
novae are just built up hydrogen on the surface of white dwarfs reaching
fusion temperatures and detonating -- but nothing like the amount that
supernovae create; the vast majority of the energy of a supernovae is
released in the form of neutrinos -- and you know how impressive the
electromagnetic portion of the portion is.  In actuality the
electromagnetic portion is more of a secondary burp.

However, the neutrino flux from an impending supernova (the neutrino burst
will reach you before you see anything wrong with the star) is only lethal
to something on the order of 10 au.  Definitely insystem.

I've never heard anyone suggest this as a mass extinction explanation; do
you have references?  It's terribly clear that the neutrino flux is nowhere
near strong enough.  Not by a long shot.

If you're talking about Niven's speculations about the Ringworld surviving
the Core explosion, he was wrong.  Not only is there significant gap, but
the galactic magnetic field will divert charged particles every which way.
The Ringworld will not survive.

A good point.  _My_ point about FTL is that it gives you the "early
warning" and "quick getaway" capability; after all, blasting a star and
escaping (or signalling) to a friendly system at or below the speed of
light means that you (and the friendly system) cannot protect yourself
from the nova/supernova fury...
Another case of Mutual Assured Destruction :)

On another (related) topic, I've recently read some commentary on the
Kardashev scale for grading advanced civilizations.  As I recall, it's:

K1 -- Civilization energy output equals energy output of a planet
K2 -- Civilization energy output equals energy output of a star
K3 -- Civilization energy output equals energy output of a galaxy

This scale seems fairly vague, as most proposed interstellar
civilizations would fall somewhere in between 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 (BTW,
what would a K3 civilization look like?).  Case in point, would a
Ringworld (which utilizes only a portion of its sun's energy), be a K2
civilization?

Are there more accurate (accepted) scales of measuring technological
development?  I'm working on a scale called "Modified Kardashev";
keeping the standard classes, but adding decimals to indicate
intermediate steps. Example: K0 would be nontechnological societies,
K1.5 would be a society capable of interstellar travel (either STL or
"cheap" FTL such as the Star Trek warp drive) and terraforming, and K2.5
would be capable of stellar modification.  Comments?  Critiscm? 
Suggestions?

This scale was intended as a gauge of how much energy the civilization
could put into radio communication.

It's an intriguing but very fuzzy scale.

What sort of star are they talking about, for example? A M8 red subdwarf?
A F2 yellow-white star?

How many stars are in the galaxy the scale mentions?

There's a lot of play there, and as mentioned there's a lot of room
(D'oh!) between 2 and 3! I suppose 2.1 = 10 stars, 2.2 = 100, . . . ,
2.9 = 1,000,000,000 would work, with 3 ~= 10,000,000,000 stars. Ten
billion is not quite a galaxy's worth, but once you hit that many
systems . . .yeesh.

Really, developing a one-size-fits all taxonomy for civilizations
out yonder would be tough. You'd need all sorts of weights and measures.

This is true, but it depends on exactly what is happening in the Core.

True.  The lag is on the order of hours.

Conventional novae involve the surfaces of white dwarfs, so I don't think
it's irrelevant.

Pretty much, although the Kardashev scale involves the power output
available to the civilization for utilization.  Type I civilizations
involve power comparable to that of the insolation of the Earth from the
Sun.

To one significant figure, the powers involved are:

        I        4 x 10^17 W
        II        4 x 10^26 W
        III        4 x 10^37 W

A type II civilization has 10^9 times more power available to it than a
type I, and a type III has 10^11 times more power available to it than a
type II.

Good question.  These definitions are, of course, abstract, and only
introduced for the sake of classifying possible discoveries.


> Case in point, would a

> civilization?
The Ringworld derives its power from its shadow squares.  Assuming that the
entire collective area of the squares can be used for available power
(ignore efficiency losses; it was built by Pak, after all :-), and
according to the data in the Ringworld roleplaying game, they occlude 6.0%*
of its sun's output, which given as 3.6 x 10^26 W, gives 2.1 x 10^25 W.
This puts it at just below a type II civilization.


> Are there more accurate (accepted) scales of measuring technological
> development?
I haven't heard of any, although these kinds of classifications are so
abstract there's not much use in revising them further.

My idea is to use a logarithmic scale, similarly concretified as in the
stellar magnitude scale**.  The divisions between type I and type II, and
type II and type III in the Kardashev scale are not logarithmically equal;
let's make them so by choosing our scale as 10^10 (the geometric mean of
10^9 and 10^11).  Furthermore, let's choose a "civilization magnitude" (not
calling it a Kardashev scale anymore, since they differ now) of M = 2 at P
(power available) = 3.827 x 10^26 W, defining the system based on the
luminosity of the Sun.

From this, we find that our function M(P) is 

    M = 0.0434 ln P - 0.658

Our civilization, according to the _1994 World Almanac_, consumed 346
quadrillion (US) btu in 1993; this is 3.65 x 10^20 J.  Averaged over 1 y,
the power is 11.6 TW.  (Think about that when people talk about terawatt
lasers.)

In this system, our civilzation qualifies as a civilization of magnitude
0.647.  Not too bad.

-----
* The data sheet gives the size of each square, the number of squares, and
the average spacing.  It separately gives the insolation portion of the
squares as 5.5%.  Using this data to calculate the circumference of the
shadow square ring and thus its radius, and using everything to determine
the relative areas, I get a 6.0% insolation percentage.  If I, however,
mistakenly pretend there are 20 gaps (20 squares means 19 gaps, not 20),
then I arrive at their 5.5% figure.  Oops on them.

** Originally the magnitude scale was non-mathematical, with six divisions.
First-magnitude stars were the brightest, and sixth-magnitude were dimmest,
just at the limit of visibility.  Some comparison showed that the intensity
of first-magnitude stars was roughly 100 times more intense than
sixth-magnitudes, so the mathematical rigorification [is that a word?] of
the process involved a logarithmic process with each smaller magnitude
being 100^(1/5) = 2.512 brighter than the last.

It uses our Galaxy as a reference, which has a luminosity of about 10^11

Ok, let's hypothetically say that we've got a Bobble generator that can
project a Bobble big enough to englobe an inner part of a star (and
something that can survive long enough or project at enough range to
survive).  

Bobble the center of the star.

Wait until the bobble dissipates.

What's the effect?

(boy, this would be fun to simulate.  Is there any 'Accrete' type programs
that a PC could run to do this simulation?)

I've been trying to figure out the 'worst' weapons and their effects.  High
technology is assumed (i.e. force fields, stasis fields, FTL, etc.).

I had some idea that the Kardashev scale was logramithic, but I never
took the time to work out the function.  And the idea of a "civilization
magnitude" is nice.  Mind if I use it?  
Thank you for your comments; and the note on "Terawatt lasers" is
certainly well taken.  Replies like this help make science fiction

If the squares are linked to form a ring, there should be as many gaps

As a followup comment (yes, to my own post), I don't necessarily suggest
that this _particular_ scale is good; it's just a rationalization attempt
at matching up remotely well with Kardashev's scale.

A much simpler scale would be, I think, a logarithmic base-10 (or perhaps
some other, larger scale) scale measuring power output with the Sun's
luminosity being the standard basis at magnitude 0.  So M' = 0 is the Sun's
luminosity, M' = 1 is ten times the Sun's luminosity, and so on.  The
equation then becomes the simple 

   M' = log P - log (3.827 x 10^26)

      = log P - 26.58

In this system, we have the following figures for different power outputs:

        thing                                power                modified magnitude
        United States (1993)                2.81 x 10^12 W        -14.1
        Human civilization (1993)        1.16 x 10^13 W        -13.5
        Kardashev type I                4 x 10^17 W        -8.98

Oops yourself.

If you have a *circle*, (as opposed to a straight line) the number of
gaps is *equal* to the number of squares rather than being one less.

Consider: square+gap repeated 19 times plus one square, leaves you with
the first and last squares immediately adjacent! Put a gap inbetween
them and you now have twenty gaps.

The inside of the bobble would remain in stasis, so it would still
be hot nuclear plasma. The star would slowly cool off and grow denser
(my guess is that this would take a few millions of years, since it
would take a long time for the photons to leave the star and heat
would be released by the contraction). When the bobble dissipates
we have a hot, fairly low-density plasma surrounded by a dense
cool plasma. There would most likely be a brief collapse where the
core would heat up a lot, followed by a quick expansion where much of
the mantle would blow off. Not a supernova, but at least a pretty
nova and a planetary nebula.

My favorite is causing vacuum decay into a lower state if one exists.
Spreads through the universe at lightspeed, makes all matter unstable
and releases something like 10^30 J/m^3. Not much left. 

Of course, even greater weapons were hinted at in the books by Peter
Nilsson (_Rymdväktaren_ and _Nyaga_, both in Swedish): sabotaging the
laws of physics using some form of information-manipulation. Apparently
the potential was to destroy large parts of the multiverse.

Oops on you.  A ring with one shadow square has one gap.  A ring with two
shadow squares has two gaps.  How many gaps in a ring with 20 shadow squares?
20, right.  It's a straight line that would have only 19 gaps between 20
markers.  In a circle, there are as many gaps as there are markers.  See?

Oh.  I haven't read any of Sagan's nonfiction except _Cosmos_.

Still, in a later message I suggested using a base-10 logarithmic scale
based on magnitude 0 representing the Sun's output.

As for parallel scales, just take the common logarithm of the number of
available bits.  Easy.

I remember a rather silly weapon from an old SF
story about robot tanks (No, not a Bolo story).
They could make force fields that would pass matter but
not energy. They could make said fields into a self-sustaining
bubble.
 So, make one field, lob a nuke into it. Nuke goes off.
Now you have a force field with a little piece of Inferno
inside.
 Launch the field at an enemy tank. As the tank enters
the field, it is suddenly at ground zero. And none of the
energy can escape, so all of it can be utilized to
vaporize the tank.

 Offhand, I'm sure that a nuclear detonation would produce
enough of a matter based shock wave when it went off
to wreak the force field launcher.

Um, I really hate to point this out, Erik ... but take a look at Carl

Sagan's _The Cosmic Connection_. He extends the Kardashev scale into a

Umm, a fairly nasty variant (probably invented several times) enters
to my mind: catalytically dropping temperature-requirement of common
fusion reactions to negligible. The star simply releases all the energy 
it had in store for next few billion years in few hours/months/whatever.

You do not need to limit yourself to conventional nuclear weapons if
all you want is to totally neutralize a planetary civilization. Design for
a maximum yield of short lived isotopes which are readily absorbed by
the human organism, and Hitler will look like a kind uncle.
 
A combination of chemical and biological weapons may be even more 
cost-effective, but the dirty nukes would make it possible to resettle
the planet after only a short wait.

You might have to clean out pockets of survivors and well protected
bunkers, but a number of delayed action bombs could take care of
most of them when they come out of hiding.

Sure, of people, but that's not really a mass extinction.

By way of reference, several mammalian specie in the vicinity of
Chernobyl, notably a species of vole, have undergone dramatic population

I'm sure the occupants of the world would find this very comforting. :)

And besides, if you just leave the gravity turned off long enough, and 
let the pieces drift away on their linear trajectories, eventually 
they'll rach a point where they *are* at mutual escape velocity from one 
another.  Then you can turn the gravity back on.

Hmm. I've heard that strange particles have a (theoretical) ability to
'eat' neutrons, thus liberating a great deal of energy. What is
interesting is that they can keep doing this, getting more and more
massive. How massive can they get? I have no idea, but I've heard big
enough so that the particle could (theoretically again) be seen under
magnification directly.
The interesting part is that it would hold an electron cloud, so it
would behave like normal matter unless under fusion-type conditions.

Where this is leading is that it would definately do amazingly icky
things to a star.

In a neutron star, it would be even more interesting. I don't know if a
single massive strange particle would be more dense than neutronium. If
it WAS.. you could turn neutron stars into black holes. (If they were

This sounds odd.  Surely a particle's wavelength should get *smaller* as

If I were an SF writer instead of a journalist, I would attempt to
write an alternative universe story about a world were there was
a WWIII in 1962. The story would be about its consequences. My idea is
this -- if we messed up that bad, we would have a great incentive to
get off the planet. We could do it now (a la Contact) if humankind
could get its act together.

Good point.

Also few writers, even some hard-SF ones, realize just how fragile life-
forms are compared to masses of rock and metal.  (See the "Asteroid
Science" thread.  Enough nukes to destroy humanity many times over are
barely enough to budge a large asteroid at the right time.)

Yes, although the the interaction of a particle with other particles, like
photons, is not necessarily governed by wavelength. 

But a lump of strange matter would be a whole bunch of quarks (including, of
course, strange quarks) bound together by the strong nuclear force. The
theory (as of several years ago, anyway; I don't know if this is still
believed) is that neutrons (maybe protons too) that came in contact with
strange matter would be absorbed by having one or more of their quarks
converted into strange quarks with a release of energy. So if you dropped a
lump into a neuron star, the entire star might convert resulting in a very
big boom. All IIRC, anyone more up to date please correct me.

Since no one knowledgeable seems to have addressed your point yet, let me have 
a go at it.
I think I read that "charmed matter" might be able to do this.  This is like 
normal matter (actually like very condensed matter, I think), supposedly, but 
with charmed quarks replacing one of the normal, completely cynical ones.  OK, 
I made up the cynical part.  With particle physicists' naming conventions, 
you'll never know.

Anyway, I think it can eat baryons (like protons and neutrons), but would have 
electrons around it and so would not, ordinarily, just go around eating 
particles.

Charmed matter is supposed to still be very hypothetical.  But there just 
might be charmed matter stars out there.

This is, of course, all my professional recollection of particle physics.  
Unfortunately, I'm a computer programmer.

        I have heard of this scale before.  My understanding of it was that it
was developed by futurists in order to have a very rough definition of
a possible society. Also I thought it was like this:

K1 -- Civilization energy NEEDS equivalent to rescources of a planet.
K2 -- Civilization energy NEEDS equivalent to rescources of a solar
system.
K3 -- Civilization energy NEEDS equivalent to rescources of a galaxy.

        It is more of a scale of what it takes to feed a society.  This is not
simply in terms of energy needs but materials as well.  Perhaps in the
not too distant future we will become a K1 society, requiring all of
the planets rescources to support us.  If we are very inefficient this
may happen sooner than we think.  A K2 society would actively "farm"
its native solar system including its sun.  I don't mean solar power,
I mean a direct solar "tap", as well as gathering rescources from the
other planets.  Personally I have a hard time conceptualizing a K3
civilization.

        I'm not aware of any other scales but that does not mean they don't
exist.  However, if your going to moderate the scale bear in mind that
it is a measurment of size and consumption.  It does not specify
technological achievement.  I would think a K2 society would require
some form of FTL travel once it begins to exhaust its local rescources
but perhaps not.  Technological achievements are impossible to predict
whereas consumption follows a natural progression.  This is why the
scale was developed.  A society could have God's technology, but if it
is able to sustain itself on a single planet by limitting its
population it is still a K1 society.  
        We assume that anybody capable of farming a galaxy (K3) could do just
about anything.

I believe Kardashev's original formulation talked about the energy
available to a civilization, not necessarily what it needs (although the
energy that it needs would definitely be available).

This is definitely not the case.  The Kardashev scale only talks about
energy, not material resources.
