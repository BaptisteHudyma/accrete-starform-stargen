One thing which occurs to me is, you'll get some interesting weather as
the cold air on one side interacts with warm air on the other.  Not to
mention water on the light side interacting with ice on the other.
Would there be enough photosynthesis to keep oxygen in the atmosphere
anywhere near Earth's current level?

You're also going to get some wide divergences in evolution.  I suspect
that the equivalents of insects and of vertebrates would develop
separately in the light and in the dark.  So you might have two
intelligent species, about the same in intelligence, strength, etc. -- but
less closely related to each other than humans are related to spiders.

The major problem with a habitable one-face world is the "cold trap" 
effect...there's a nasty tendency for the night side to get so cold that 
all the water, or even all the *atmosphere*, freezes out there 
permanently, rather decreasing the habitability.

To get around this, you need one or both of (a) small size, and (b) dense 
atmosphere.  Small size means that heat is more readily transported to 
the center of the night side, and thick atmosphere transports heat 
better.  Because a thick atmosphere implies strongish gravity, you 
probably want a small but rather dense world -- which would tend to imply 
in turn a high-metal-content, large-core world, and also lots of 
radioactives to keep that core and mantle hot, which ties in well with 
the vulcanism requirement.

So, let's say at a guess you want a world about 60% Earth's diameter, but 
dense enough to give a surface gravity of .8 gee, and a surface 
atmospheric pressure of 1.4 bars.  This is all wild hand-waving, of 
course, but it should be good enough.

In this model, air would heat at the subsolar region (the center of the 
dayside, and rise.  It would then flow at high altitude away from the 
subsolar point, cooling by radiation into space and by heat exchange with 
the next circulation cell, finally falling again about 60 degrees away 
from the subsolar point, and flowing back toward it on the surface.  
This whole cell would be very dry; water would tend to collect in the 
second and third cells, below.

The most interesting cell is the "twilight band," between 60 and 120 
degrees from the subsolar point.  Here, air picking up heat from the star 
and from the first cell rises and flows onto the nightside at high 
altitude, lsoing moisture as it rises and cools.  This would make for a 
rainy tropical belt about 30 degrees dayward of the day/night line 
("terminator").  The dry air would drop 30 degrees nighward of the 
terminator, then flow back onto the day side as a cold wind, warming and 
picking up moisture from oceans along the terminator and dayward.

The last cell extends for 60 degrees around the antisolar point (the 
center of nightside), and is very cold and stagnant.  It's a large ice 
cap, which is in equilibrium with cell 2...it freezes and thaws at the 
margins at equal rates (though with ebbs and flows over short scales of 
time).  Heat exchange with cell 2 keeps it from sliding into "cold trap" 
mode.

Not sure about that.  Obviously, there'd be absolutely no plants on the
nightside, so any life there would have to be either transient, or the
equivalent of deep-sea ecosystems on earth -- living off either
chemosynthesis from the vulcanism, or material filtering in from
better-lit regions.  Both modes of life are pretty specialized, occupied 
by only a very limited number of species, and not the sort of thing that 
traditionally leads to intelligence.  Could be wrong, though...

Okay, I could see a situation here where there could be this one
great, planet-sized convection system, with air rising on the hot
side, flowing up and outward and around to the cold side, where it
would sink, and flow back at ground level toward the day side.  We
don't have enough spin here to churn the atmoshere as on earth, so
maybe the pattern would be stable.  This could give us one heck of a
"world wind", especially at the terminator, where there would be a
constant hurricane force wind at the surface blowing from the night
side toward the day side.

Perhaps there would also be a similar convection current in the
extensive ocean system.  

These two things may make for a planet with less temperature
differences then an airless world, like Mercury.

Hmmm... you suggested a dense world with lots of radioactives.  Even on
Earth, there has been at least one case (old Scientific American, late
1980's) in which a "natural fission reactor" was formed by sedimentation
of uranium in a stream bed, and actually reached the point of going
critical!  (this was a *long* time ago, when isotopic ratios were
different...)

So you can imagine that on a world with a lot more uranium, living
organisms would become resistant to radiation (presumably by means of
sturdy genetic molecules and good repair mechanisms for them).  The next
step would be developing an ability to concentrate uranium.  This in
itself would allow minor heat production, allowing a small but crucial
expansion of range into the cold side, creating a special niche from
which all further cold-side organisms could evolve.

For the next step I'll assume they have something like an electric eel. 
In other words, an animal that can produce an electric current by means
of having many layers of cells stacked up, each of which pushes charged
ions through a membrane on one side, but acts more or less open on the
other.  Now, mutate the channel so that it no longer moves something like
chloride, but instead moves uranate.  The uranium ions should have enough
of an isotopic effect that this allows the organism to conceivably
develop a good isotopic separation.

So now we have this nifty precursor to all dark-side life.  It takes in
uranium from the oceans (which we'll assume are replenished by
weathering; there will be an equilibrium between number of organisms and
concentration of uranium ions).  It heats itself with a near critical
mass of U-235.  It probably does best on the dark side because it can't
go *too* close to critical without frying even its studly DNA substitute,
so it needs to have a good "cold sink" for generating energy (between its
heated uranium mass and the outside world).  It will probably develop
sophisticated methods of radiation shielding - most likely by using
U-238, a heavy element which it already has in its body.  But this leads
to a "breeder reactor" - and a whole plutonium ecosystem based on this
primary producer!

However, predation might have some limits.  If a male and female of this
species take up a lifestyle in which they remain closely paired, then
they have a "defense" against all manner of predators - they put their
little heads together and twiddle the cells with the U-238 in them so
that they go forward-to-back with holes between, instead of lining up
straight.  This allows the radiation from the U-235 masses to send them
critical (dissipating the U-238 layer further), causing the whole area to
go up in something that might be only a fizzle yield - unless there's
some benefit for it to evolve further...

This is hell on the predators.

Such organisms might likewise become the terror of the light side.  Their
larval forms might "recapitulate ontogeny" and have a lifestyle that
requires them to live in the planktonic region of the sunlit side.  So
the adults would drift in the cold currents at the bottom of the ocean,
mating, living in their internal heat, lying almost dormant, until the
current finally brings them up to the surface, where the heat starts to
threaten their safety.  Then, they instinctively release their eggs to
the current, allowing them time to spread, before they use the power of a
thermonuclear explosion to scatter their seed across the oceans, remove
potential predators, and create plenty of dead organic matter for their
offspring to eat.

Without light, and hense, without photosyntheis there wouldn't be much of
a food chain on the dark side.  Probably the only active life would be
arround volcanic vents.  

Evolution would be a bit warped.  Continental drift would gradualy
bring continents from the light side to the dark and back again.  Isolated
continents would suffer mass extinctions as they went over to the dark
side.

It gets more interesting if you propose that the planet isn't completely
tidally locked.  An effective rotational period of 1000 years would give a
definate advantage to those critters would can fly or swim.

The star itself would probably be a red dwarf in order to allow the planet
to get close enough for tidal locking but still not be too hot for life.

These winds would still deposit huge amounts of ice as precipitation on
the far side.  Perhaps, if the far side only consisted of ocean, and there
were currents sufficiently vigorous to break up the ice and move it back
into the sun, you could avoid a cold trap.  If there are significant
continental land masses on the far side, then you are in trouble.

Wouldn't the accumulation of heat on the facing side of the planet 
be just as unpleasant, or can that be ameliorated more easily than
the cold by "moving" the planet further and further away from the
star?

Would it be possible for a planet to rotate on it's axis _and_ have

Can anyone give me a short answer what the prevailing winds would be like
on a tide-locked world with an approximately earth-normal atmosphere (if
such a thing is possible?)?

Convection would move heat to the far side where it could be radiated
away.  Water freezing releases large amounts of latent heat.

The first life on the ash fields of Mt St Helens was insect, dropping in
from the aerial plankton. If the drive for mobility were high then mobile
forms would evolve - floating plants, floating forests, flying and floating
beasts and plankton, feeding in the light, drifting on the great curents of
air into the dark and out again. Would it freeze up when trapped in the cold
though? Different phases of life, like elvers and eels? Would it carry heat
with it into the cold? Predators sucking out the energy needed to survive in
the cold...
  When is this due out? I want a copy.

Yes, but.  Rock surfaces will absorb and store quite a bit
more heat than an (increasingly thin) atmosphere will be 
able to convect away.  Imagine walking across a beach on
a hot afternoon that never ended.  How much of Mercury's
surface temperature is the result of being that close to
the Sun, and how much (for the facing side) is the result
of never getting a sunset?

If the planet's orbit is very eccentric, you'll get seasons in the
twilight zones. The planet will be rotating at a constant speed but
won't have a constant angular velocity around the star, so the east
and west sides will be exposed at different points in the orbit.
Of course if it's very eccentric, you'll get seasons anyway.

What about a moon? If it's big enough, it'll cause tides which will
stir up the oceans, ice layer and magma. Given a high albedo, it could
even reflect a significant amount of heat and light back onto the dark
side, maybe enough for photosynthesis.

The pole would have to be facing the sun, which would require a rather
drastic change in the planets orientation, probably involving a huge
comet strike in its past.

Not if you mean that the axis of rotation passes through the poles.  (I have

Think "gyroscope."  The rotating planet will have each pole pointing in the

I don't think so. It would have to rotate around two axes: the spin
axis you mention, and a second one perpendicular to that that keeps
it rotating at the same rate it revolves around the star. 

The problem with this is that even the smallest asymmetry in the planet
would cause this double rotation to put a big torque on the planet, and
the rotation axes would tumble. Hmmm... or does it? This is a harder
question than I thought. A gyroscope will tumble if you apply a force
to rotate the spin axis. Will this also occur if the object is freely
rotating in space? In other words, if you have a spinning object and
let it roate around a second axis, will it tumble?

Anyway, the chances of this configuration are very small. The Moon shows
one face to us because tides have coupled with its spin to slow it down.
If the axis is not perpendicular to the orbit than this won't happen. Tides
will apply a torque to the satellite, and you get weird motions again.

I have a description of tides and tidal evolution on my homepage:

Not really.  A rotating object tends to keep its spin axis in one
direction; that's what makes gyroscopes so useful.  For the pole of a
rotating planet to stay pointed at the sun, you'd need to apply a
continuous torque to the planet to drag the pole around (super-precession,
sort of).  I don't think you could get enough torque to do this outside
the Roche limit, for any significant planetary rotation rate.

        Several possible physical conditions come to mind:

        You would have a differential distrabution of heavy elements 
 on the sun facing side.  The result of a magma interior being pulled 
preferentailly to one side due to the unidirectional tidal(gravitational) 
effect. Note the effect on the Moon..where the locking process caused the 
luner core to develope closer to the earth facing side.  Also note the 
degree of magma (mare) formation due to this effect.  
        The crust on the sun facing side will also be thinner due to this 
same effect.  The convective currents within the mantel would rip through 
this thinner layer and begin pushing the crust away from the sun side to 
the dark side.  (Picture the rifting sequence occureing in the Mid Atlantic 
trench.) At the Dark side you might get plate and contental collision 
occuring as these components now are forced back together. 
        The sun side of this planet would be far more likely to have volcanos
, and rifting sequences occuring.  The dark side would have exhibit 
contential collision, and associated earthquakes and faulting.  A good 
example would be the Himalayas (India/Asia collision)...and the west 
coast of North America (California to B.C.)
        From a Climate perspective ..differentail high pressure zones on 
the sun side...

        Anyway...just regional geophantasy...don't ask me to put money on
it. (ha ha ha)

The ice build up and crust displacement wont help your planet stay one

Ah, but if that moon is big enough for significant tides, won't it be too
big to leave a planet in a synchronous rotation?  Won't the gravitational
attraction exerted by the moon break the pattern that would make a world
a "one-face" planet?  (Damn, I'm frustrated that I let my math go, and

If the moon is big enough to stir up tides and/or reflect that much 
light, then our one-face world will lock to the moon's revolution period, 
not to its own revolution period around the star.  Though this would 
likely give it a long (perhaps weeks long) day/night cycle, it wouldn't 
have permanent day and night sides anymore.

Uranus is already like this; it has a tilt of over 90 degrees.

But for the pole to _constantly_ point through the star, you'd need a
constant and massive torque being applied to the planet.

If it's very eccentric you won't get a 1:1 spin-orbit coupling.  What
produces this effect is tidal braking, which is *very* sensitive to
proximity.  At high eccentricities, the planet is braked to a halt with
respect to the star at *periastron*, rather than the mean star.

For certain values of eccentricity, this can lead to lower symmetries of
spin-orbit coupling: for instance, an eccentricity of 0.2 gets you a 3:2
resonance.  That's Mercury.

>Of course if it's very eccentric, you'll get seasons anyway.

Entirely the former.  Folks, it's been known for over 30 years that
Mercury does *not* keep one face to the Sun:  its rotation period is 59
days, while its year is 88.  The optical observers were fooled by some
coincidences, but the first radar observations cleared up the error.

(No, it is not an accident that 59 is 2/3 of 88.  It's now understood
that a planet in an elliptical orbit like Mercury's tends to end up in
a 3:2 rotation:orbit lock rather than a 1:1 lock.)

A very long day, very long night, might be just as interesting
a science fiction setting.  What if we moved Mercury out a way
(made it bigger, etc.) gave our new planet a 3:2 rotation:orbit
lock.  365 day year (for instance), 240 day "day" (off the top
of my head, and I'm _bad_ for mental math)...

And an elliptical orbit?  I suppose the side of the planet in
night and day while closest or farthest from the sun would
alternate on some reasonably determinable schedule.

The geological activity and weather for a 1:1 locked planet
seemed to be quite severe (from what you'all have been saying.)
What about a 3:2 locked planet large enough to have atmosphere
and significant liquid oceans? (A reasonable distance from the
sun, of course.)

What about something like Forward's "Rocheworld"?  It would have the torque
of the tidal forces working on it, wouldn't it?

I'm interested as I'm (gut level, haven't done the math yet) thinking that
smaller 'brown' stars might have habital planets located VERY close to the
primary,  I'm interested in qualitative effects of tidal forces.  Can't
remember, but I think Accrete (not that it's scientifically accurate any
more) will predict when a planet becomes tidally locked.  I'm just
wondering what would happen if a planet was close enough for this to occur,
BUT started with a highly inclined orbit (like Uranus).

Although I imagine that Uranus must have some pretty fierce winds and
strange ice structures itself, although I doubt it gets much heating from
the sun (mostly internal, I believe).

I haven't read "Rocheworld."  There are ways of inventing weird situations
where you could get constant torques that just _happen_ to keep the body's
second-order rotation in sync with its orbit, but now it's getting a little
silly . . .

Tidal forces tend to slow a body's rotation relative to its primary, not
change that body's rotating axis.  That would require far too much torque.

The restoring torque that occurs because of tidal slowing is due to
equatorial bulges.  The Earth, for instance, is not a perfect sphere; so
the bulge on the sunward side gets pulled harder than that on the rearward
side, inducing a torque.

The more inclined the rotation axis of the body, the less this torque is.
It's a maximum for an axis perpendicular to the plane of its orbit.

Strange ice structures, in a jovian world?  :-)

_Voyager II_'s flyby of Uranus wasn't terribly interesting, but Neptune's
was amazing.  Planetary astronomers were expecting Neptune to be even more
drab and lonely than Uranus, but they found shattered worlds, active
geysers, and unbelievably strong winds.  No one considered that the lower
temperature meant less friction.

I don't have the book on the shelf, but it's an egg shaped moon the size
(roughly) of earth in orbit around a Jovian, *I think*.  I believe that the
'point' was pointed at the jovian in some kind of tidal lock, but boy, I
could be wrong.

Makes sense.  Of course, a small M type star could have VERY old planets
around it, giving plenty of time for tidal effects to work.  Guess I'll
have to work out some figures, but it's probably far easier to ignore the
idea.


> Strange ice structures, in a jovian world?  :-)
Well, we didn't say what kind of ice <G>.
I wasn't typing or thinking very clearly ... I guess what I meant was a
'terrestrial' planet with Uranus's tilt in a close orbit would have some
pretty weird ice formations.  Seasonal glaciers, etc.   Each pole would be
in sunlight about half the time, and without a really thick atmosphere like
Venus, I think you'd get extremes of temperature.  The polar ice caps would
be pretty thick during 'winter' and would probably melt right off during
summer.  That would be an incredibly active place to be.  Imagine the winds
.. 

Of course, we've got a good tilt and it isn't THAT bad.

Interesting about the friction.  At a rough guess then, if you were to
categorize, it sounds like anything the temperature of Neptune is going to
be boring, anything the temp of Uranus or Jupiter might be *very*
interesting, at least if you like wind <G>

This sounds vaguely like Niven's Jinx, except for an end being in tidal
lock.

NO, NO, NO!!!
Rocheworld was *much* stranger than that.

I don't have the book in front of me so I can't give you any
details, but the astrophysics were impeccably worked out.

Rocheworld was a double planet, with a separation something
like 500 *miles*. There was actually an atmospheric bridge
between the two. Tides molded them into egg shapes, with the
pointy ends aimed at each other.
 There was another periodic phenomenon that I'll neglect to
mention in the interest of spoiler protection.

Whoops, I think I got that backwards :-(

I saw an interesting thing at Siggraph talking about using vertical scaling
to make mountains like Mons Olympus look very dramatic, whereas in real
life it's actually kind of flat (high, but not a 'peak').  The short film
also talked about using false color in pictures of Saturn (you knew there
would be a point to this).  I think of this issue when I display Gas giants
... Uranus and Saturn actually look kind of bland, is my recollection. 
I've actually had sort of a hard time finding hard data on this; a lot of
astro photography taken from 'serious' observatories uses false color to
bring out data.

The Tidally Locked Earth sounds interesting. What sort of story is to take place
there? Is there a civilization? At what level of development?
A few comments:

* There almost certainly *will* be a land mass at each "pole" - Sunward and
  Darkward. The planet must settle with long axis straight up and down, as
  far as mass is concerned.

* Winds and ocean currents at the surface will be moving in opposite directions:
  Sunward and Darkward respectively. Whitecaps at the terminator. This
  tendency toward rough seas may be attenuated somewhat by the fact that that
  is also the location of the greatest "cross section".

* A civilization evolving in the termerate zone (30 to 45 degree latitude?)
  is going to have the devil of a time keeping track of time, or even developing
  the concept of "days", "years", etc. The sun is going to be in the same
  place *all* the time. How shall durations be measured? What determines when
  the "day" starts/ends?

* Sailing ships will enjoy a steady supply of wind, and currents heading
  Darkward will eliminate the need for tacking back-and-forth into the wind.
  Ships *will* need to be hydrodynamic in design, in order to be able to sail
  up-current. If the civilization gets technically advanced enough to build
  submarines, then they will cruise near the surface to go Darkward, and
  submerge below the thermal layer to head Sunward.

* Navigation will present a formidable problem. Latitude is easy - just measure
  the angle of the sun. But how do you know your longitude, even if your
  civilization did develop a concept of time and invented a mechanical clock?

This would be an approximate method only, but:  If the planet's
sun rotates and has sunspots, one could track the path of a spot
and measure the angle between that path and the horizon.

This is an interesting problem, but I think they'd get around it.  There
should still be plenty of pseudoperiodic phenomena relevant to their
lives - the time required for a certain type of plant to grow, the
menstrual cycle, the time it takes one of their relative's corpses to
decay.  Whatever they choose, it will be less relevant than our own time,
since there really are fewer time-related effects.

What's more interesting, however, is what this would do to *plants*!  We
look at our trees and grasses and take them for granted, but they're
cunningly designed to intercept as much sun with as little material as
they can, given that the sun moves and they respond to it.  By contrast,
a non-moving sun stresses entirely different strategies - the plant never
needs to make any reaction to changing sunlight, but should be as big and
rigid a plate of photosynthetic material pointed at the sun as is
possible.  But the plate has to stick out past all the others, so there
may be stalks going up to a tilted upper plate.  Since the shade beneath
layers and layers of plate would be nearly absolute, plant evolution
should stress expansion by existing large individuals, rather than
trusting to seeds except for heavily disrupted areas.

The weird part about all that is that since the surface would mostly be
dark, under the plates, but the parts exposed to the sun are (whatever
color, let's assume "green" for staidness), a person orbiting the planet
from above would see the temperate hemisphere as a dark greenish mass,
until he crossed almost directly sunward from the planet, at which point
it would all flash brilliant green for just a moment.

If the whole surface is covered with tilted plates poking far up into the
air, it seems possible that this may actually affect wind and weather
patterns, simply because the wind should flow more smoothly and freely if
it moves toward the dark side, but with more turbulence the other way. 
And since you'd expect the prevailing wind to naturally be the cold air
from the dark side, heating up and returning far above, this tendency
would oppose that wind flow.  If I really wanted to get far-fetched, I
could argue that the resistance would increase from super-giant plants
until the wind flow was so hindered that convection was slowed, heat
accumulated, and mass fires broke out, at which point the situation would
return to normal.  This would generate "seasons"... but I bet those
plants would have to be just *ridiculous* in order to interfere with the
wind that much!

The flow in any fluid spanning dark and light sides will be:

- Light -> Dark at high altitude/low depth (farther 'above' planet)
- Dark -> Light at low altitude/high depth (less far 'above' planet)

This is because fluid is heated by the star on lightside, rises, and 
flows away 'higher' (since it's hot, and thus less dense), then cools on 
darkside and sinks, flowing back 'lower' (it's cool, and thus denser) to 
complete the mass transfer balance you're worried about.  This very 
process happens in modified form in six great convection cells on Earth, 
three each in northern and southern hemispheres.  The band of deserts 
around the world at 30 degrees north/south are where air heated over the 
equator, which rises, cools, and dumps its moisture there, drops back to 
the surface and begins flowing back toward the equator again.

Not as long as the atmosphere and oceans don't freeze out on the darkside 
(see earlier posts on this thread).  You have a heat engine; the star 
pumps energy onto lightside, and interstellar space sucks energy off of 
darkside.  The continuous air/ocean circulation is driven by this energy 
flow; it's the most efficient way to transport the heat.

Do you measure latitude towards sun closest surface point ?
Remember: the rotation axis is perpendicular to the orbit's plane.
Equador is coplanar with the orbit's plane.
isoazimutal lines cross the equator sow how can you tell latitude from
sun angle ? Only works on mid-day meridian.

Another strategy might be to have windmill-trees that exploit the
constant winds near the terminator.

Or OTEC-weed that circulates liquid across the temperature gradient.
Big dark heat-collector shrubs on the sunlit side, then buried roots
to exchange liquid with big pale radiator shrubs on the dark side.

It still seems to me that the facing side of the planet is
going to get much too hot for life.  Even if it hovered around
the same temperature as one of Earth's daytime deserts, plants
in that environment do not adopt the strategy you suggest.
The cactus and the Joshua tree seem more interested presenting
long, pointy limbs to the sun, so as not to overheat.  

Big leafy "platforms" are more of a strategy for jungle plants
below the canopy.  They need to collect as much light as 
possible.  If you put a leafy plant in direct sunlight, it
burns to a crisp.

   Not really very close. Rocheworld, as described, consists of two
almost equal-sized planets in a very tight orbit, tidally locked to each
other. Rotation is in the ecliptic plane, so the pole does not point at
the sun.
   If you want to keep one pole pointing at the sun, you pretty much have
to cheat. You can put the object in orbit about a fairly dark source, a
Jupiter-sized gas ball. Put this whole thing in a very long orbit around
a very bright sun, with its orbital plane perpendicular to that of the
gas ball around the sun, and for several years at a stretch the pole
will be pointing more or less at the sun. Or, put the planet in orbit
around a dark object, put this collection on the edge of a dirty nebula,
and put a whole lot of bright nearby stars around the whole thing. The
nebula blocks light coming at the planet from one direction.

Earth plantlife needs night.  How much can we extrapolate

Check on relatively recent reports of VERY hot places on (and in the crust
of) Earth which have life.

Begins to look as if life evolved on Earth at temperatures that would fry

If I understand correctly, the answer is Yes. I am considering the place
where the sun is directly overhead to be 90 degrees Sunward, the terminator
as zero degrees, and the center of Darkside as 90 degrees Darkward. It seemed
more convenient than to use the axis of rotation.

Well, certainly thermal vents at the bottom of the ocean would
be very inhospitable to many of the Earth's life forms.  I am
not saying that life couldn't evolve on a hot planet (though
complex molecules do get busted apart by excessive heat, do
they not?  I would think that "higher forms" of life would
be unlikely to evolve on such a planet, even if it could
support them if they arrived from somewhere else).  It just
seems to me that plantlife would not be big and leafy, but
rather scrawny, like a desert cactus or shrub.

The Big Leaf school of sfictional botany has been popular mainly because

it makes the plants look suitably unearthly, but in this case it's not
the sun that makes Earth's plants grow little leaves; it's the
atmosphere.

Leaves are mainly designed to gather the CO2 needed for photosynthesis
from the air, and to do this they need as thin a boundary layer as
possible.  The boundary layer thickness is roughly proportional to the
square root of leaf size, so small leaves can gather CO2 faster than big
leaves [1].

There are reasons for the exceptions :-)

I think so.  So every other "noon" would be extra warm
because of the eliptical orbit.  Provided you lived at
a point on the surface that lined up with perihelion.

The more habitable regions might be those that don't
line up with the sun at perihelion (or the point where
the planet is furthest from the sun, whatever that is
called.  I used to know.)

They'll have some weird ideas. But I suspect that the fact that the
world is round will be discovered a *lot* earlier. That's the only way
to make sun angle measurements match with distance from noon.

I don't think it's possible for a locked planet to have stable
satellites. So they won't have a moon to observe.

The law of gravity will be a *very* late discovery (a *correct*
version, that is). The question of "what keeps the sun up" may not ever
*occur* to them.

Focault's pendulum rotates once a *year*, so that's out.

Easy. The ground on dayside is warm, getting warmer as you approach the
center of dayside. Hot air rises. So replacement air will have to come
from darkside. The basic circulatory pattern will be air at high
altitude flowing towards nightside and air at low altitudes flowing
towards dayside. This sort of thing tries to happen on Earth (for
slightly different reasons). But a tidally locked world will have
negligible Coriolis forces acting upon the wind patterns. So they'll be
radial from the center of dayside to the center of nightside and vice
versa. 

This will tend to move moisture to nightside, where it will give off
heat as it condenses into rain & snow. This will help moderate the
climate of nightside. 

I can't say if there'd be enough keep nightside from getting *really*
cold, but I suspect that given enough moisture it wouldn't get much
worse than the south pole on earth. 

You'd get *massive* glacial buildup on nightside, but with enough
water, the glaciers would flow into dayside (and the rain on them
nearer the terminator would help).

Every *other* orbit the same point has noon at perihelion. Call the
point closest to the sun at perihelion this orbit pole A. Next orbit at
perhelion, it will be the *farthest point (ie instead of noon it'll be
midnight). And the point directly *opposite* will be closest (Pole B).

I goofed a bit. The planet has 1.5 "days" per "year". So it works like
this: 

day        orbit        pole A        Pole B
---        -----        ------        --------
0        0        noon        midnite
0.5        1/3        midnite        noon
1        2/3        noon        midnite
1.5        1        midnite        noon
2        1 1/3        noon        midnite
2.5        1 2/3        midnite        noon
3        2        noon        midnite                <--- See where the 3:2 comes from?
3.5        2 1/3        midnite        noon
4        2 2/3        noon        midnite
4.5        3        midnite        noon
5        3 1/3        noon        midnite
5.5        3 2/3        midnite        noon
....

So it's every *third* noon that's hot.

Nope, this is where you goofed, Leonard.  You were right first time,
since where there are three turns per orbit, there are two orbits per
day.

It's a 3:2 *spin*:orbit coupling, and a turn is not a day.  For example,
Earth spins once every 23 hours and 56 minutes, but the sun rises once
every 24 hours.  For the same reason, the minute hand goes round the
clock in 1 hour, but only crosses the hour hand after 1 hour and 5.45
minutes :-)

Why does the moon, which has an elliptical orbit, keep a 1:1
lock?  In fact, what orbiting celestial body doesn't have an
elliptical orbit?

Without knowing the exact figures, and the amount of tidal locking
(has to do with mass ratio and distances, I think), you need to
compare the distances and masses of the earth/moon system with the
mercury/sun system.  The axes and differences in orbital distortion
are different.  
I suspect that it's due to the 1) sun being far more massive in
comparison.  2) Mercury being much closer in proportion, and 3)
Mercury's orbit being much more eliptical.  

Then again, I haven't researched it at all, and don't know enough
orbital dynamics to tell.  I'll have to figure out some sort of
triggers if I'm going to program parts of it, though.

They're all elliptical, true, but Mercury's is highly elliptical -- 
eccentricity higher than 0.2, as I recall, second highest among the Solar 
System's planets (behind Pluto).  It's a high-eccentricity, low-radius 
orbit that leads to 3:2 locking.

An elliptical orbit *like Mercury's*, ie. eccentricity in the region of
0.2.  The Moon's eccentricity is close to zero, hence a 1:1 lock.

The requirement for resonance is that the central star should stand
still in the sky *at periastron*, where the tidal forces are strongest.
So, for instance, a planet with an orbital eccentricity of 0.33 would
likely have a 1:2 spin-orbit resonance (and hence a day exactly as long
as the year!).

For more fascinating thought on fictional planets, read Stephen Gillet's
excellent "World-Building" [1] (note, though, that his suggestion of a
*retrograde* 3:2 lock won't work, for obvious reasons).

Perhaps the glaciers would get massive enough that they'd have an
influence on tectonic activity.  Any continents that peeked out would be
instantly weighed down by truly massive glaciers.  Perhaps some glaciers
would get so massive that their ice would press down the underlying plate
enough to start getting subducted.  This would release massive amounts of
steam and cool the underlying magma in the process, thus thickening the
crust at that point and bringing the release of steam to a halt.  What
influence would this have on weather patterns?  This could end up being a
cycle.  Perhaps every 10 million years or so, cold, damp air will pour out
of the dark side to bring moisture to lands near the terminator.  

This planet might be a great setting for a Norse-flavored sci-fi/fantasy
hybrid. You have the lands of darkness and ice, and the regions of light. 
Life might well have evolved differently on the dark and light sides.  Add
a colony of humans whose civilization has crumbled, and you got a smashing
great sword & sorcery/space opry!  (But hopefully with better science than
the Pern books.)

One thing for sure, for there to be life on this world, there'd have to be
a *lot* of water.

Because of tides; they impart an active restoring force that tends to make
a body's revolution period match its rotation period.

Now, naturally, they can't match instantaneously all throughout the orbit,
since the Moon's orbit is elliptical.  But the periods match.

Because it matters *how* elliptical the orbit is.  Although the
eccentricity of the Moon's orbit can't be entirely ignored -- for example,
it's a nasty complication for some applications of the Lagrange points --
it is relatively small and does not mess up the basic 1:1 tidal lock found
in circular and near-circular orbits.  Mercury's eccentricity, on the 
other hand, is large enough to make a real difference.

This is why the moon "wobbles" in its orbit, I believe -- we can actually
see about 53% of the Moon's surface from Earth at the right times in its
orbit due to the wobbling...

That's correct.  The process is called libration.
