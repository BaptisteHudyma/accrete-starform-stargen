1 = size (x1000 miles -> diameter)
2 = atmosphere (um, 7 is standard breathable I think)
3 = hydro (x10 is % water coverage)

   Well actually a '6' atmosphere is standard (aka Earth), a '7' would
be standard, tainted (the taint being a harmful component that could be
anything from industrial pollutants to sulfur compounds from volcanoes
to suspended particulates to "use your imagination").  Tainted
atmospheres can be breathable without filtration for a few minutes or
even many years depending upon the world (if you don't mind dying from
lung damage or cancer one day).   Native lifeforms of course would be
unaffected by atmospheric taint, and humans can be adapted to breathing
it with no ill effects through genetic engineering (man-made or the
"natural" way through evolution or selective breeding) or through the
use of cybernetics.

   UWPs really haven't changed significantly in Traveller since the
early 80s, though how they are generated is badly in need of an overhaul
in light of astronomical dicoveries made since that time and some design
flaws.  The third edition of the rules (TNE) made some adjustments in
the creation process (not enough IMHO), but UWPs are still UWPs.
