TITLE: Wanted: Combat Algorithms && Landscape/Solar System Generator 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thursday, 30 January 1997 08:00:00 UTC - Robert Gasch:
Hi, 
I've been looking through all sorts of search engines but have not 
really found anything on the following subjects:

1) I'm looking for some algorithms to handle combat of armies 
consisting of different unit types. Also, if anybody has any 
ideas on how to implement tactics (formations, etc), I would 
appreciate a pointer in the right direction. 

2) If anybody knows any good landscape/world generators, I would 
also appreciate a pointer. 

3) I once (something like 10 years ago when Internet was not more 
than a loose connection of Telnet and FTP sites) saw a piece of 
code which generated data for a simulated solar system. The final 
data would include planetary types, orbit info and other related 
stuff. Unfortunateley I can not find anything like this. 

Thanks for any hints

The best place I know of to look, is Captain Barcode's War Room

GrimmWare is nearing release of The Genesis Engine, an easy to use
terrain generator based on plate tectonics.  It will be available
as a 32 bit dll as well as a 32 bit static library.  You can check
out some pre-release information at our web site ...

Check out Virtek 3D-Ware Game Library @ www.virtek.com <http://www.virtek.com>
also check out WGT 5.0

Both are good 3D world generators.
