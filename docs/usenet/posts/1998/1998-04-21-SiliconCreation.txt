Hello all:
Does anyone know where I could get a copy of Fogg's 'Silicon Creation' source
code?  I've been trying to write a Win95 version of his program (looking at
plenty of journal articles on the way), and having the source code he used
would make things a lot easier.  I'm not sure if Silicon Creation is public
domain or not; if it isn't, then just pretend I never posted this.  Any help
would be much appreciated.

   While there are several versions of 'a' source code availible (I
presume you've found them), none of them appear to be Fogg's (in fact,
some of them contain some interesting errors, especially in the Accrete
subroutines). I wrote Fogg to request the source, and he replied that is
was on a discarded machine in his garage, and even he wouldn't retrieve
it, but write it from scratch again if the situation ever came up. So it
looks like no dice. If you do find something, please let me know - I've
looked to the point where re-creating seems the better option.
   In addition, which version of 'Silicon Creation' are you trying to
model? There were at least three (and possibly more). The one that
incorperated seven different types of atmospheres (although the most
interesting) was the least accurate, and there were at least two
variations on the Accrete subroutines as well.
   I, too, am re-writing this program (how many times has that been
done, I wonder?), and I'm just using a current version (Starform) as a
guide - there are a lot of improvements possible, in speed, memory, and
certainly accuracy.
