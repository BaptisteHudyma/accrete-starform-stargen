TITLE: Worldbuilding questions 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Saturday, 11 April 1998 08:00:00 UTC+1 - cin...@juno.com:
A couple of questions related to worldbuilding:
1.  I was looking at Fogg's JBIS article where he wrote about Silicon
Creation, and some of the formulae in that article required stellar ages as
inputs.  So I'm wondering:  Is there a way to find the _ages_ (not the time
they spend on main sequence) of stars like Alpha Centauri, Tau Ceti, etc.?
Any equations or tables I could use for this?

2.  On a related note, what are the scientific laws that govern where certain
types of planets can form around a star?  Is there a limit to how close gas
giants can be (I'm pretty sure there is, but I'm not sure _what_ it is)?  Are
the environments of Mars and Venus a function only of their proximity to the
star, or are there other factors involved?

Any help would be much appreciated.

Not really...at least from what I've read about with the 'newly'
discovered planets.  There are .5 Jupiter mass planets about .05 AU from
their parent star...

Try looking at http://wwwusr.obspm.fr/departement/darc/planets/encycl.html <http://wwwusr.obspm.fr/departement/darc/planets/encycl.html>
for a listing of planets found.  Let's say some of our old theories got
shot in the foot about planetary formation...if not there are some mild
changes to be seen...:)

   Careful. While it's true that Jupiter-mass planets inside 1 A.U. were
not expected, it does not mean they formed there [1].

   That's probably a fair assesment.
