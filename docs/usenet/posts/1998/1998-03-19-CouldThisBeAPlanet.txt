        I am in the 8th grade and we about to take a state wide test
involving open ended questions in various subject. We got a sample
question the other day to help us prepare. What our class and science
teacher are debating is weather this imaginary planet "Ronda" could really
exist. Look over this table.

Good info.  I'll take each point and try to explain what is reasonable and
why.

>-------------------------

>Distance from star : 100,000,000 km

Okay, 100 Million km.  The Earth is 150 Million Km from the Sun.  So, if
Ronda's stellar primary (it's 'Sun') is about the same as ours in luminosity
(brightness), Ronda would recieve about 2.29 time the energy per square
meter that the Earth does.

This means it's going to be hot.  Very hot.

>Rotation: 230 days
>Revolution : 230 days

If the rotation period is exactly the same as the period of revolution it is
called a 'Tidal Lock.'  However Ronda would need to be much closer to it's
star in order for this to have occurred.  And if you didn't want Ronda to be
a baked slag-ball world, Ronda's star would have to be much smaller than our
Sun--maybe a red dwarf (an 'M' spectral class star).

This also means that Ronda has a day-side and a night-side.  The temperature
on the day side will be incredibly hot--because it is always exposed to the
light of Ronda's star.

>Diameter : 7,930 (Same as Earth)
>Density : 2.00 g/cm3

Okay, this doesn't add up.  The size of the planet is okay, however the
density is whacked.  2.00 g/cm3 is only twice the density of water.  The
Earth has an average density of 5.5 g/cm3--that's pretty much Iron and
silicates.  Some moons of the outer Jovian worlds (Saturn, Neptune, etc)
have comparable densities, but they are mostly water ice over a silicate
core.  So Ronda would appear to be made of water ice--which isn't likely if
it's surface temperature is perhaps over 100 degrees Centigrade--all of the
ice would melt and the water would boil away.

>Axis tilt : 0 degrees

The effect of axial tilt is the 'seasons' and in this case would have a
slight moderating effect on the extreme temperatures of the dayside.

>
>Atmospheric Content-
>O2 (Oxygen) Levels : 5%
>CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) Levels : 60%
>N2 (Nitrogen) Levels : 10%
>Traces : 25%

<grin> 25% is not a 'Trace' level. Ignoring that, lets look at the rest.

Alright, mostly Carbon dioxide with molecular Nitrogen and molecular Oxygen.
Two important bits of information have been left out here--the Surface
Temperature and if Life is present.

Free molecular Oxygen will only exist if there are photosynthetic organisms
using a chlorophyl analog--either bacteria, algae or plants that eat CO2 and
give off O2 as a waste product.  No life, no O2.

If the surface temperature is in excess of the boiling point of water, no
photosynthetic lifeform that we know of could survive.  On Earth the only
critters that can survive boiling-hot enviroments are chemosynthetic
bacteria that 'eat' sulfur compounds.  They do not, as far as I am aware,
give off Oxygen as a waste gas.

Carbon-Dioxide is a perfectly reasonable gas to expect in the atmosphere of
Ronda.  However, if 60% of the atmosphere were CO2, Ronda would be a runaway
'Greenhouse World' like our nearest planetary neighbor, Venus.  On Earth
only a fraction of a percent of the atmosphere is made up of Carbon
Dioxide--if it were just a few percent, the Earth would rapidly become a
Greenhouse World like Venus.

What keep the Earth's CO2 in check?  Life!  Plants and algae absorb CO2 and
sunlight, converting it into sugar and Oxygen.  The Oxygen in our air is
actually a waste product from all of the Earth's photosynthetic plants.


However, Oxygen is a very reactive gas.  It combines very easily with all
sort of chemicals and elements, 'oxidizing' them.  Rust is one
example--Oxygen reacting with Iron.  It is unlikely that a planet would have
very much O2 in it's atmosphere.  5% sounds okay for the Oxygen component of
the atmosphere.

Molecular Nitrogen is a stable, non-reactive gas.  Most of the Earth's
atmosphere is made up of N2, mainly because 1) photosynthetic plants
consumed nearly all of the CO2, giving off O2 as a waste product. and 2) the
O2 was absorbed by the oceans and reacted with minerals.  There is still
plenty of excess Oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere, thanks to the plants and
algae.

In short, it would be reasonable to have a high-Nitrogen/CO2 atmosphere, or
a high-Nitrogen/low O2/low CO2 atmosphere.

>Magnetic Field : no

Well, because Ronda is not very dense, it probably doesn't have a very large
Iron core (if it has one at all).  The Earth's magnetic field is generated
by it's massive Iron core.  Because the Earth spins, it acts like a very
large dynamo, generating a huge magnetic field.

Mars, much like Ronda, doesn't have as heavy a core as the Earth, and it may
not be as hot, too.  Mars doesn't have a very strong magnetic field.

>O-Zone layer : no

This is spelled OZONE.  Ozone is tri-atomic oxygen (three-atom oxygen) or
O3.  Ozone is created in the upper regions of the Earth's atmosphere by the
bombardment of O2 by ultraviolet light (or 'radiation') from the Sun.  The
Earth's ozone layer absorbs most of the UV (ultraviolet) light that reaches
the Earth.

If Ronda does have a significant amount of Oxygen in it's atmosphere, it
would most likely have a significant ozone layer.
>---------------------------
>
>The question we want to know is if a planet like this could really exist?
>

Well, when I am creating a 'realistic' world for one of my science-fiction
roleplaying games, I create a world in one of two ways:  Top-down or
Bottom-up.

Bottom up is the most realistic.  Start with the world's star and the
planetary system.  I usually run an 'accretion simulator' to place the major
bodies (everything down to the size of the largest asteroid).  Most of the
time I end up with a body of significant size within the star's bio-zone.
The bio-zone is the area around a star where liquid water can exist.

With our Sun the Earth is about smack dab in the middle of the biozone,
Venus is too close to the Sun to be in it and Mars is just outside it.

Next I look at the characteristics of the main world--Size, Composition,
Density, Mass, and Gravity.

Size.  Pretty self explanatory--how big is this world.  For a good
life-bearing planet, a diameter between 8000 km and 16000 km is good.

Composition is what it is made up of:  How rich in silicates or Iron.  Is
the core of the world large enough to be molten.  How abundant are trace
elements like radio-isotopes, which help keep the core hot as they undergo
radioactive decay.

Next is it's average Density.  Actually most of the time I figure this out
first and extrapolate the Composition of the world from it.  Density can be
expressed in grams per cubic cm or as a percentage of Earth's density.
5.5g/cm3 is equal to 1.0 DensityEarth.

I can calculate the planet's mass by multiplying it's volume by it's
density.  A quick and dirty way to figure this is to take the planet's
diameter in miles, and divide by 1000, rounding up.  The Earth would be
'size' 8  (7915mi / 1000 = 7.915, rounded up to 8).  The planets Mass =
Density/Earth's density x ( Size factor / 8 )^3 (cubed).  This gives you a
result in 'Standard Terran Masses' where 1.0 = Earth's mass.

Finally, if you know the planet's mass and it's size, you can calculate the
mean surface gravity.  The planet's surface gravity in G's = Planet's Mass x
(64 / Planet's Size^2<<squared>>).

So, say I had a medium sized world, say 7000 miles/ 11200km in diameter,
composed of a mostly rocky/silicate core ( 3.85 g/cc or .70 Terran density).
This world would only mass 47% of what the Earth does and have a surface
gravity of .61G or 2/3rds the gravity on the Earth.

Next I have to make a decision--does this world have life.  If so, I have
some choices of atmospheric composition--O2 and N2 being preferred for a
colonizable world..  If not, the atmosphere is likely to be composed of
Hydrocarbons (Methane), CO, CO2, and Nitrogen.

From here I would figure how bright this planet's star is and how far away
it orbits.  With that information and information about the atmosphere of
the planet I can calculate the approximate surface temperature.

I hope this has helped.  Please feel free to e-mail me with any questions,
or check out 'world building' resources on the web.

Hmmm...  about .7 AU from the primary... about like venus.

Hmm... tidal locked. About like venus.

Agreed. The venus' density is about 5.25, a shade lower than earth's.
The lowest density among the inner planets is mars at 3.93. This is
VERY low density for a planet that close to a star... unles the star
happens to be a red dwarf. :-)

(Snip) Agreed.

Well, all I can say is that the only way that this planet could have
oxygen is that it recently had plantlike lifeforms in it's oceans -
currently and recently. Given its density, it would have to be made
mostly of some form of Ice... water or otherwise. To have liquid
water, the only ice that can exist is water ice.

So, lets say there is a thick envelope of water ice surrounding a
rocky core. Near a small orange or red dwarf star, perhaps this planet
might receive just enough light to melt some of the surface ice into
ocean-sized puddle on the sunward side. So yes, I thinkit is a
stretch, but I think it MIGHT be possible. It is pretty hard to
imagine even primitive life evolving on a world like that, but I guess
it is possible.


However, if you are assuming that this world orbits a star like our
own, then there is no way this is possible.

Don't forget that the star is smaller than the sun. From the distance and
orbital period of 230 days calculate the star's mass, guess it's type,
etc. I'll leave the details to the experts, but it seems the luminosity is
much smaller than our sun's, and the planet might not be so hot after all.

Wow. I wish I'd been tested this way rather than the "those who
can't do, teach" method. Is this sort of helping with the homework
allowed? Oh well, it's too much fun to miss. 

You don't mention the type of star Ronda is orbiting, but I see a
problem with a density of 2 g/cm^3. That's only twice as dense as
water, which implies that the planet contains a lot of water or ice
(like some of the moons of Jupiter) rather then rock or iron
which has a density > 5 g/cm^3. It's not an Earthlike world around a
G star, but it sounds plausible.

BTW, why not quote the diameter as 12,000 km ?

        Not neccesarily. Not knowning the mass of the central star, the Q of

the planet or the orbital eccentricity, it's not a impossible situation.
You mention later using an "accretion" model (I presume ACCRETE,
Starform, or something similar) - some of these do lock/syncronous
rotation calculations, and I don't think a tidal lock at 0.66 AU is out
of the question, particularly with all the free variables.
> And if you didn't want Ronda to be a baked slag-ball world, Ronda's

        Let's think about this. As you mention later, there are some glaring
gaps in the information supplied - such as the surface temperature and
the presence of life. But at least the first of these we can
approximate. (Warning: for the original poster, the following goes
slightly beyond what you probably need to know for a 8th grade contest).
We know Ronda orbits its star in 233 days (I'm assuming 24-hour days).
That, coupled with the orbital radius (about 0.66 AU), gives us the mass
of the primary: about 0.71 Msol (71% of the mass of the Sun). The
luminosity for stars in this range can be approximated as
        L = Lsol ( M / Msol )^4.75
which give as luminosity of only 0.2 that of our Sun. Ronda receives the
equivilent inslation that a planet at 1.48 AU in our own solar system
would - slightly more than Mars. Not very hot at all.

        That does seem unrealistic, but there are at least two classes of solar

system bodies that come close to that density - gas giants (Jupiter, for
instance, is 1.3 g/cc, while Saturn is 0.69 g/cc) and icy moons
(Callisto is around 1.8 g/cc, but has a diameter of only 2987 mi). I
agree that it seems impossible, but I'm not *sure* it is. Can anyone
calculate the theoretical density of a all water-ice body the size of
Ronda, taking the numerous polytrops of ice into account? Or the density
of a all-water body?
> So Ronda would appear to be made of water ice--which isn't

        At the projected surface temperatures (close to Martian), this is not
quite as impossible as it might at first seem. Still *highly* unlikely I
think.

        And another one - the surface pressure.

        Not exclusively true. I agree that the presence of free oxygen in the

atmosphere of the average planet is highly unlikely except in the
presence of life, but there are exceptions. Europa's atmosphere (such as
it is) consists of oxygen produced from sublimated water ice (the
hydrogen having been lost due to thermal escape). If the "surface" of
our planet is only water (and if a *large* pecentage of the bulk
material is water also), then the possiblity exist for water vapor to be
converted into hydrogen and oxygen by UV in the upper atmosphere. The
hydrogen is lost, while the oxygen sticks around.
        OK, no, I would think life is more likely too.
> If the surface temperature is in excess of the boiling point of water,

        But taking the probably stellar luminosity into account, Ronda would

probably be within the potential ecosphere. Life is not out of the
question, and a possible explaination for the O2 content.

        Perhaps. I'm not sure how much CO2 is needed to produce a runaway

greenhouse at that illumination level, and more importantly, we don't
know how much CO2 is present because we don't know the surface pressure.

        Based on what? If life is present, certainly. If life is not present,

very doubtful (barring unusual circumstances like I mentioned above).

        Or a high-N2/low-O2/high-CO2 if life was just getting started - like

during the first couple billion years of Earth history (ie- the majority
of it - before any higher life had come on the scene).

        I'm guessing you're using "ACCRETE" or something similar. Which
specificly do you use? And what else does it generate? I'm currently
adapting the Starform program for the Mac (and planning some
updates/expassions; Fogg's original 'Silicon Creation' program seems to
have been much more detailed). Much of what you mention as calculating
is done automaticly in some more advanced versions of this type of
program (such as Starform).

Hmm, good points, but based on the examples at hand (all nine in our solar
system) a retrograde rotation is more likely.  Perhaps the first
interstellar surveys will reveal which of us is correct. *grin*

Ah, but Europa's atmosphere has a third the density of a flatulent episode
in the Astrodome.  Question is would photodecomposition of H2O to O2 and H2
occur in a dense atmosphere??

Good point.  Although O2 is going to be very rare in a reducing atmosphere.

I've used several versions of Accrete.  For RPG, I find Accrete3, modified
for compatibility with the Traveller RPG is good because it does its
darnedest to create a habitable main-world.

Certainly it's hard to imagine forming a predominantly icy planet
that close to a solar type star. It's worth remembering though that
several of the detected extrasolar planets are so close to their
stars that they couldn't have been formed where they are now either.
The general belief is that these planets were formed further out, and
then dragged (by an inflowing disk), or scattered (by interactions
with other planets or smaller bodies) into their current orbits. At
least if the first disk-based scenario is right, there could be
smaller but equally out-of-place planets that were dragged inwards and
are now inhabiting the inner regions of those planetary systems.

The escape velocity of the hypothetical world mentioned above is
pretty low, so it might well be the case that the water would all
be boiled off within a few Gyr (though I haven't checked). But
oddballs like a larger ice / water world around the location of
Earth might well be possible...

        Venus's retrograde rotation is probably the result of the last
mega-impact or two, something Accrete (and for that matter, most BotE
calculations) don't take into account. Of course, I said "not knowing
the mass of the central star", and then figured out later that it was so
low tidal locking would be extremely unlikely. Maybe Ronda had a
near-synchronous period accidentally, and over a long period of time
(low mass star implies a long time on the main sequence) the final tidal
locking occured.

        I agree; I really wish we could be around to have this discussion then
;-).

        Good think too - it gave the rest of us something to do <grin>. But
seriously, it probably shouldn't have been needed - this was presented
as a problem for 8th graders. I agree with another poster to this
thread, I *really* wish I would have had more chances to do this sor tof
thing, but I would *not* expect an 8th grader to have the main sequence
mass/luminosity relationship memorized.

        Certainly - it is thought to have occured on Venus, for example. If the
planet's atmospheric structure does not posses a cold-trap, water will
be present at all altitudes, and photodisassociation can proceed. A more
important question in this setting is if Ronda's (small, weak) star will
put off enough UV to drive the process (I'm guessing no).


> I'm sorry, that should have been 'If Ronda has life, 5% O2 sounds 
> okay'
        And life seems at least possible. I agree - life is probably implied by
this problem. I only mentioned the UV trick around a water-world to
point out that assumptions should be questioned, especially when we only
have one system (the solar system) to base them upon.

Well, each of us can contribute our own stash of info from time to time.
This just matched up on a lot of things that I've read about and mulled
over.
