TITLE: Titus-bode correction??

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wednesday, 11 March 1998 08:00:00 UTC - Alan D Kohler:
Hi all,

Last year, I ran across the page of a well-spoken budding SF writer
who had a variation of the titus-bode relatationship that corrected
the factors for different stellar masses. I wanted to incorporate it
into a system I am making for simulating star systems, but can no
longer find the page - online or in hardcopy. Does anyone here know of
such a postulated solar mass corrected titus-bode formula?

That's a neat trick, considering we know of no other complete planetary
systems against which to judge the model.

I'm not familiar with this particular notion.  However, a simple
geometric sequence (the Titius-Bode relationship is not quite
geometric), r = A B^n, can fit to the sizes of the orbit of the planets
relatively well, particularly if you include the asteroid belt and
exclude Pluto.

Who said it had to be accurate - just beleivable. Need I remind you
that their is an "sf" in the title to this group. Speculation is part
of the trade.

You've missed the point. I *do* undertand what titus-bode is and do
understand that it is an emprical relations based on observations of
our own system. But this gentleman had a reasonable version of the
titus-bode law scaled for other systems. The titus bode relationship
is, as you will recall:

General form:
Orbit        Distance
1        0 x N + C
2        1 x N + C
3        2 x N + C
4        4 x N + C
5        8 x N + C
6        16 x N + C
....

Where N is .3 AU and C is .4 AU.

Now, the formula this gent set forth, N and C were scaled by
fractional powers of the stars mass in solar masses (something like N
= .3 AU x M^1/2 + .4 AU x M^2/3 - the numbers aren't exact, that's
what I'm trying to remember) I don't know if he had any reason for the
powers he used, or if they were just wild speculations.

Just as an aside, one Doctor has done some research suggesting that
there is a mathematical basis behind the titus-bode relationship, but
I don't recall his name right off... I just stumbled accross the
article when I was doing the search for the info I am requesting here.

I did something similar several years ago (actually, over 10 years ago) and
it worked fairly well.  However, lately I'm using the ACCRETE source code;
with modern PC's it's plenty fast enough.

I believe the titus-bode 'law' has to do with harmonic arrangements, which
makes a lot of sense.  ACCRETE solves for this, I believe.

I still have the original ACCRETE somewhere on cards, actually.  I found it
at Cornell, after doing some work on the Drake equation for a paper I wrote
as an Undergrad.  However, there's modern C versions that are easier to work
on.  I've hacked a C++ version and am still working on it.  This is for a 3D
solar system visualization project.

Well, if you don't need something to be accurate, you can just make up
anything!

Yes.  And what I am telling you is that you can scale it yourself, just
as arbitrarily.

Given a geometric relationship:

    r = A B^n

A governs the characteristic scale of the system (if you start with n =
1, then A does not correspond to the first orbit), B governs how much
larger each orbit is than the last one.  For the Solar System (Mercury
through Mars, Ceres, and Jupiter through Neptune) you can get a
moderately good fit (average error 10.02%) for A = 0.204 au, B = 1.733.

A better metric would include more parameters, such as mass or radius or
type, or perhaps a term which tended to make resonant orbits more
likely/stable.  Either way, you can add as many terms as you like to
make the curve a better fit.

Considering the exact nature of the Titius-Bode law is thought to be a
lucky accident, it is highly unlikely that they were anything but wild
guesses or fooling around.

There are also other things to consider when dealing with evolved stars,
which is that orbits get changed as the star evolves.  When a star
leaves the main sequence and turns itself into a red giant, it undergoes
a mass loss episode where it sheds a significant amount of its outer
envelope.  This causes the planets to spiral out somewhat, due to the
gradually decreasing mass of the primary.  Ultimately you end up with a
white dwarf, with planetary orbits out further from what they were, with
a gap in the middle.

There almost certainly is some vague relationship.  The bodies are
probably placed at roughly geometric spacing because the density of the
accreting matter in the protosolar system varied as e^-r.  So far out
you'd expect to see few bodies; close in you'd expect to see more.

Well, you can't just make up anything, otherwise you don't fit
criteria B - beleivable!

Well, I troubled to read through the abstract of the Doctor I
mentioned above (Dr. Robert Bass - anyone heard of him?) His abstract
suggests that the orbits of adjacent planets with orbital periods that
are rational multiples of one another cannot be stable unless they sit
in a titus-bode kind of relationship. His abstact also suggests that
the actual relationship is not as we discussed above, but rather:

D[n+1] = D[n]*beta

D is the orbital distance of orbit n. Beta is, uncorrected for
planetary masses, 1.80. (corrected for planetary mass, B = 1.8 +/- .2)
Under this assumption, it is not neptune that is in the wrong place,
but EARTH! (His abstract didn't detail HOW Earth gets away with being
in the wrong orbit... perhaps earth's orbital period is a non-rational
multiple of the orbital periods of Venus and Mars... anyone care to
punch the numbers into their calculator to confirm this?)

An implication of this is that planetary orbits are not FIXED
absolutely, just fixed *with respect to one another*. This implies
that the placement of planets is, somewhat arbitrary. A method of
simulating a system would be to randomly pick a distance for the inner
planet, and then place the rest of the system by multiplying by Br.
Bass' assumed beta of 1.8 +/- .2. This will even work for systems of
the "post gas giant" model that you suggested.

Ana advantage of using this approach in simulations is that it allows
us to simulate systems like 51 Peg. 51 Peg is a G-type star similar to
our own. However, there is a near-jovian mass planet very close to the
central star - on the order of 1/2 or less (IIRC) of what would be
mercury's orbit. Under the solar-mass dependant model I mentioned
earlier, this kind of arrangement is not possible: any sun similar to
ours should have similar orbits about it. but under Dr. Bass' model,
we can set the inner orbit arbitrarily.

Any comments? Can anyone comment on the validity of Dr. Bass or his
paper. Abstracts for some of his work is at:

http://www.kronia.com/bass.htm <http://www.kronia.com/bass.htm>

BTW, I do know about accrete - and have used a version of it myself.
However, what I am looking for here is a little more "quick & dirty"
type of thing that you can do with a pencil, paper, & calculator.

Since there are no sensible or widely-believed theories regarding the
spacing of planetary orbits, nearly _anything_ is believable.  There is
no standard against which to test things.  You could pick the orbital
radii randomly, and it would be hard to argue against the possibility of
such an arrangement, simply because we have no standard against which to
compare it.  Other than the avoidance of very-closely-spaced orbits or
orbits connected by resonances, basically anything is possible.

It sounds like there is a fundamental problem with this approach. 
Models of planetary formation are, just like any other models,
_explanatory_ models.  They are intended to explain what is observed. 
Particularly when you're talking about a situation as complicated as the
formation of a planetary system, and ultimately the spacing of the
orbits that arise (which is a terribly complicated, quite stochastic,
and probably chaotic system), coming up with a model, and saying, "Hey,
here's my model.  I think it's a good model.  However, Earth (or in the
case of the Titius-Bode relationship, Neptune) doesn't fit," is kind of
missing the point.  Naturally cataclysmic events, which, though rare, do
happen, will alter a system from its "natural" planetary configuration
(if such a thing actually exists, which is probably unlikely) to
something changed, and may eventually cause global perturbations,
destroying the original ideal configuration.  Either way, if this is
one's explanation of why the model is inaccurate (which it is in these
cases), then one must immediately explain _why_ the model is inaccurate
-- was the Earth bumped in from some outer orbit, was there some
interaction from an interloper that, say, separated Neptune and its
former moon Pluto (hypothetically) to cause the current configuration? 
If these aftereffects aren't immediately apparent, then the model is
worthless.

Note, though, that even with this model, you get a roughly-geometric
global spacing of the orbits.  Each orbit is some (moderately variable)
factor larger than the previous orbit.

That planetary orbits follow a roughly geometric pattern is probably
never very surprising, since inward there is lots of accretable
material, and outward there is much less.  Not only does this mean there
is more material to make planets in the inner system, but it means that
when planets form in the outer system, they get huge, because they tend
to get large before other planetesimals can gobble up their food.  So
you get terrestrials insystem, jovians outsystem, with a roughly
geometric sequence (better modeled if you divide the curve fitting
between an inner system and an outer system, divided at the line where
jovians tend to be favored over terrestrials).

I would recommend a simple geometric relationship (forget Bode's law,
because it is too specific and contrived):

    r = A B^n, 

where r is the radius of the nth orbit (counting from 0).  Here things
are very easy -- A is the radius of the 0th orbit, and B is the ratio
between successive orbits.  Add in a +-10% error for good luck.  Choose
A and B to come up with interesting results (for the Solar System, A =
0.39 au, and B is roughly 1.6).  Vary A and B according to the stellar
type.  Make them proportional to the stellar mass, for instance, say, or
proportional to the stellar luminosity (o= M^3.5).

Not exactly true. *I* personally wouldn't beleive a system that allows
two earth size worlds within .1 AU... or 2 jupiter sized worlds within
.5 AU.

Well, Dr. Bass claims that it's not just the accretion density - it is
orbital dynamics. However, I, too, felt that the fact that Earth
didn't fit the model made it seem just as contrived as the standard
titus-bode.

Well, I was considering making a model based on Dr. Bass' model... but
found his "earth doesn't fit" a little disconcerting. I am more liable
to beleive that a small gass giant in the outer system can more easily
stray from the geometric position that an inner planet where m/r^2
relationships are much larger.

What I figure I'd do is select an inner planet orbit arbitrarily, use
for A, make B something like A* .8 +/- .05, and then use those numbers
in the standard titus-bode to find the "base line" orbits, and vary
the actual positions from those base lines by some random factor.

I qualified my statement in the part that you omitted.

So just pick up a system that gives reasonably-spaced worlds.

If you're referring to a geometric relationship like the one that I
cited, r = A B^n, then this doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  A and B
are in different units (A is units of distance; B is dimensionless).  If
you were referring to A as being in astronomical units, then for the
solar system, A/au = 0.39, and so B = 0.8 (A/au) would lead B to be
something smaller than unity, which means that successive orbits will
array themselves _inward_, rather than outward.

But, other than that, this is basically the same kind of relationship I
was talking about.  Use a simple geometric series (or maybe two, one for
the terrestrials, one for the jovians), and throw in a random fudge
factor.

I'm referring to the form I threw out: D = A + B * N, where N = 0 for
orbit 1 and N = 2^(orbit# - 2) for all other orbits. For example, lets
say that I use  R * M^.5 * .1 AU for the innermost orbit, where M is
the mass of the central star in solar masses, and R is a random
variable we will simulate by the roll of one six-sided dice. Lets say
I want to figure orbits for Epsilon Indi. Epsilon indi is a K5V star,
estimated mass = .67 Msol. for our dice roll, we get a 4. The
innermost orbit would be at .33 AU, => A = .327 AU. Use 1 dice - 1
dice, summed times .01 to produce the proposed variation in B. a 6 and
a 3 results in a proposed variation of .83. B = .83 (.327) = .272

Orbits for this system would look like this:

Then make a center weighted randon distribution about each ideal orbit
to find an actual orbit.

Two is a possibility I had considered... jovians fit Dr. Bass' "times
1.8" rule pretty well, but inner worlds tend to follows a less
predicatable sequence.

With a simple geometric sequence (r = A B^n), one gets only a 5.5%
average error for the inner four planets (worst:  Venus, 10.5%; best: 
Earth, 0.88%), for A = 0.416, B = 1.558.  And one gets only a 4.5%
average error for the four jovian outer planets (worst:  Uranus, 8.7%;
best:  Saturn, 1.2%).

One could even be fancy and choose two curves, but which are both
connected:  Orbit 0 is the terrestrial-jovian boundary (defined however
you like), somewhere between Mars and Jupiter in our system; orbit T1 is
the first terrestrial inward from the boundary (i.e., Mars), orbit T2 is
the second terrestrial inward (i.e., Earth), etc.  Orbit J1 is the first
jovian outward from the boundary (i.e., Jupiter), J2 is the second
(i.e., Saturn), etc.  Both would be geometric sequences, except that the
terrestrial sequence would have B < 1 (monotonic decreasing) and the
jovian sequence would have B > 1 (monotonic increasing).

For science *fiction* purposes, I suggest making the baseline distance
proportional to the square root of stellar luminosity.  There's no
particular reason to believe this relationship is correct, but there's
no particular reason to believe it isn't either, and it gives the best
chance of habitable planets, because it means the middle terrestrial
planets will get an amount of illumination similar to what Earth gets.
