TITLE: GURPS Traveller: How does Strephon survive? 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Monday, 16 February 1998 08:00:00 UTC - Michael Cule:
Has anyone at SJG yet decided how it is that Strephon survives in the new
timeline for GURPS Traveller?
If not, may I draw their attention to the possibilities inherent in IRIS, the
Imperial Regency for Intelligence and Security, written up in one of the 
Traveller Digests (if memory serves). 

They form an elite bodyguard for the Emperor and some of them have psionic
training. As a prerequisite for his assasination of Strephon, Dulinor had them
discredited and removed from the Imperial entourage.

How about a IRIS precog having a last minute vision (in a dream?) of the
upcoming chaos? A crack team of IRIS agents (psis and non-psis) trying to get
close enough to the Emperor to prevent the death would make a lovely scenario
(although probably better suited for convention play than inclusion in the 
actual book itself....)

I'd prefer it if they simply laughed it to scorn and wrote the whole
thing off as a bizarre attempt by wargaming gearheads to hijack a
perfectly good background so they can play high-tech tank battles.

You can tell I didn't like it, can't you?  ;-)

It looks like Dulinor has a little "accident" on the way to kill Stephron.

In my campaign, I had the Aslan Ambassador save Strephon by taking Dulinor
out with his dewclaws, dying in the process.
There were various groups set to rebel on schedule, but they were put down
without too much difficulty, except for Dulinor's sector (I'm blocking on
the name).  My campaign runs in the Spinward Marches, so we only saw some
fringe activity -- in my game, backed by rogue factions *within* IRIS and
the Navy.  Norris was essentially on top of things, and has now been made
an Archduke.  ;-)

I find the shattered Imperium offensive as well, further aggravated by an
article in The Gamer where someone from GDW (don't recall who) said "We
were bothered by the fact that so many Traveller campaigns center around
illegal activity, like piracy and smuggling and killing people.  We
thought that was immoral in peace, so we set up a setting where players
could do it in the context of a civil war, so it's morally okay."

I thought that line of reasoning went out at Nuremburg, along with the
"just following orders" one, but maybe it's just me.

(Note that I am *not* arguing that in-game activity needs to be "morally
 correct."  Just that if you're going to take that position, as at least
 one GDW staffer apparently did, you'd better be consistent.)

I am afraid that it is just you.  Since no country goes to war claiming
that it is in the wrong, indiciduals in a war will by definition work
under a different moral code than they would in peace time.  Many men who
would never kill in peace time, nor possibly even own a gun, have killed
in war, and I am sure that there are many more who will in the future.
However, unless they are delibrately targeting civilian targets, Society
as a whole will not claim that they acted immorally.  And if their side
wins the war, they can probably get away with even less savory actions.

As for the GDW argument however, I agree that it is silly.  If players
want to play pirates or smugglers, then that is their business.

There are a few TNS articles that show where the break occurs between GDW
and GURPS 3I.  You can see them at

It could be that IRIS decided to take a pre-emptive step.

There is, however, a real problem with the canonical "Traveller" universe: 
the lack of a "lawless frontier."  Most campaigns are set in the Third
Imperium, which isn't really surprising, since its the focus of most of
the background material.  Unfortunately, however, Imperial civilization
has a very long history, and it's surrounded by several equally
well-established spacefaring societies.  In such an environment, is it any
wonder that excitment-seeking player characters tend to gravitate towards
illegal activities?

Instead of shattering the Third Imperium, I would have just stolen a page
or two from "Star Trek," and used some kind of "techno-babble" to make a
frontier environment available.  There are lots of possibilities.  It's
already been established that the Ancients were capable of folding space
and creating pocket universes.  Perhaps they also created a "stable
jump-conduit" to the Andromeda galaxy, or one of the Magellanic Clouds, or
some unexplored portion of our own galaxy.

Tuesday, 17 February 1998 08:00:00 UTC - Jeremy Reaban:
Yeah, but there is something of a Frontier. GDW never really focused on
them. You can go left (west) of the Spinward Marches. FASA had this
territory, and called the Far Frontiers sector. It's mostly pocket empires
and client states of the Zhodhani (to the North) and Imperium (to the
right). Then, you can go past the Solomani rim (South, towards the rim of
the galaxy) - GDW never did anything with that. And the NE is still open.
Just the N, E, SW, SE, is blocked by aliens...(I think).

   Whatever floats your dingy...

   I went along with the storyline development and had a good time with
it...still do in fact.  I still run a thriving TNE campaign right now.

I actually think it would be more ironic if it really was an accident.
It fits with the the stuff Loren put it (when the Duke dies, the
plot is uncovered and the troops involved are rotated out).

Hmm...  There were a number of ways they could have handled this, this one
is particularly interesting.

Suppose that Strephon was behind it...  Now if Dulinor's Daughter the new
Arch-Duchess finds out, it could lead to a major revolt.  It would make a
very interesting opening to a campaign if the players were imperial agents
whose job it was to stop that revolt, but without killing her, or even
making the matter public...

On the other hand it could be a genuine accident, win which case
suspicions will remain high, but will probably remain unresolved for a
very long time.

Oh yes, Gurps Traveller looks like it is going to be very interesting.

I personally liked Mega-Traveller, but this should be just as good.

Hmmm... not a very satisfactory reason if you ask me (judged purely on the
TNS articles).  The date (131-1116) mentioning Dulinor is only 1 day prior
to the canonical date of Strephon's assassination.

It is too early to tell, however, until SJG releases a more in depth
analysis (referee's eyes only) into the events leading up to that date--
for at least a year prior, I would hope.  Otherwise, this "temporal fork in
the road" appears too much like a "quick fix", IMHO (certainly nothing like
the events that take place in GDW's "Survival Margin").

Dulinor has "accident".  The Ieliesh Guard - Dulinor's People BTW- gets
its officers decimated.  Hmmmmmmmm - sounds like someone decided not to
let his good friend assassinate him.  This isn't a kinder gentler Strephon
is it?

Here's a thought:  Maybe Dulinor figured out that his plot had been
uncovered and faked his own death.  That preserves him for use as a 
big-name villain and upholds comic book credo about not finding a
body...

 The 2d space always bugged me.  I tried coming up with a 3d map but, because of the way Traveller ships move, this causes some problems. 
If you look at a standard 2d hex map, a jump n ship can reach 3n^2+3n hexes.  In a 3d hex map, a jump n ship could reach 2n^3+6n^2+4n hexes (actually, this 
depends on the exact method used to extend the hex map to 3d but, the problem remains the same--in any 2d mapping scheme the formula will have a square as its 
highest power but, in any 3d mapping scheme, a cube will be the highest power). 

jump               2d              3d           ratio (3d/2d) 
----              ----            ----          ------------- 
   1                6              12               2 
   2               18              48               2.67 
   3               36             120               3.33 
   4               60             240               4 
   5               90             420               4.67 
   6              126             672               5.33 

As you can see, the higher jump number ships increase their reach much more dramatically than low jump number ships.  If you keep the stellar density low, 
then low number jump ships become worthless.  If you make the stellar density high enough for jump 1 and jump 2 ships to be useful, than any map more than a 
few parsecs across becomes very difficult to read.

  Lucan's bad enough for use as a villain. There were even veiled hints
in pre-MT 'Digests' that Lucan might try to wack Strephon if Strephon
attempted to rein him in.

Actually, the Vargr extants are pretty lawless and there is gap
between the Zhodani Consulate and the Aslan that is pretty unknown.

Not a bad idea, actually.  The only trouble is, what is .3 or .8 of a hex?  This would
work better with 3d cartesian coordinates, where you used the distance formula instead of
counting squares or hexes.  But, that makes it tedious to determine which stars are
within jump range.

Well, just a suggestion, you could multiply the jump ratings by 


[the cube root of (jump/6)]squared
so you get:


 Jump Rating   Actual Jump
      
      1             3.3
      2             4.2
      3             4.8
      4             5.2
      5             5.5
      6             6

This gives the same ratios of reachable space for each drive. You can then either
rule that, say, red dwarves tend not to have planets and concentrate solely on 
yellow dwarves, or divide by say 3 or 6 to give a feel of 'flat' Traveller
star distribution.

Bit of a kluge, I know, but you know converting from 2d to 3d has got
to have a klugey solution.

Ooh <sharp intake of breath>, I wouldn't use hexes in a 3D map. Instead, I'd convert to
light-years, round off to the nearest, and use cartesian. Then, if I didn't want to
fiddle with calculators or spreadsheets, I'd draw up an hypotenuse table for X against Y 
up to 20 l.y., then reiterate to get XY against Z. Umm, something like this:

 x->  1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10
 y    
 1    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10
 2    2    3    4    4    5    6    7    8    9   10
 3    3    4    4    5    6    7    8    9    9   10
 4    4    4    5    6    6    7    8    9   10   11
 5    5    5    6    6    7    8    9    9   10   11
 6    6    6    7    7    8    8    9   10   11   12
 7    7    7    8    8    9    9   10   11   11   12
 8    8    8    9    9    9   10   11   11   12   13
 9    9    9    9   10   10   11   11   12   13   13
10   10   10   10   11   11   12   12   13   13   14

So to work out the range from 61 Cygni to Sigma Draconis, you'd look up the co-ords: 
(-11,1,1) and (-17,-3,7) in Earth-centred galactic co-ordinates. Find the difference 
between the two: (6,4,6). Look-up x,y (6,4), which is 7, then [xy],z (7,6), which 
gives 9 l.y.

Still klugey, but workable if you're working out trade routes, or if players just want
to know if 61 Cygni is in jump-range. Bit of a terror though if they want to know
every starport in Jump-4 range. Oh, well.

Alternatively, I think there's some software on Winchell Chung's Star Map Site:

  http://allison.clark.net/pub/nyrath/smap07.html <http://allison.clark.net/pub/nyrath/smap07.html>

that might do the job. The one you want is CHVIEW.

Gee, I know calcualators and role playing games are supposedly
anthema, but that seems a little odious to me when it would take the
better part of 5 seconds to figure the distance between 2 stars given
x,y, and z given a calculator.

Of course, you could alway do what GURP space atlases do - once you
have a list of stars you are going to be bumping around in, make a
cross-reference table showing the distance between 2 stars showing the
distance with no calculations needed.

That's fine if you're only working with a handful of stars.  If you look at the chart I posted
a few messages back, a jump 6 ship can reach something like 672 locations (assuming you round
off star positions to the nearest parsec/light year); if 10% of those locations have stars,
that's 67 stars, making 2211 distances to work out.

I started fiddling with MS Excel yesterday to see if I could automate
my star locations/distances/etc using detailed 3D cartesian coordinates.
Having never used a spreadsheet before in my life, I was astounded by
how much I could do and how easily.

No way am I going to use something clunky like grids of positions rounded
to nearest parsecs, or pre-calculated distance tables, or hypotenuse
charts! Even generating 3D coordinates for 1000 star locations at random
(a daunting task with pencil and paper) was virtually instantaneous.

Just give me a chance to whip up some macros for working out things
like "all stars within 20 parsecs of a given star" and I'll save the
sheet and stick it up on my web page.

BTW: why are RPGs and calculators anathema? Most RPGers enjoy the
retrotech experience of tallying long columns of numbers by hand?
I see a calculator as an RPG tool second in utility only to dice (and
then dice only win over random number generating calculators because
it feels better to roll a bunch of dice than push a button).

No idea.  Calculators have always been integral to my group's gaming.
After I got my HP48, I put together a bunch of short programs to keep
track of everything.  Hit a button to choose weapon, type in AC and
hit another button to find roll needed (or reverse it to get AC hit),
type in damage taken and hit a button to record it.  Wonderful timesaver.

How about things like, "the shortest route from A to B, using jump 4 or less,
avoiding starports of class C or less whenever possible"?

I've done something like this, already, though I wrote it in Pascal rather than
using a spreadsheet.   The first problem was, I couldn't count on having a
computer available when we played.  The second problem was, it's not so easy to
pick out a route between stars that are 100 parsecs apart, for example.  Not that
either of these problems are insoluble

I agree that calculators are very useful for RPGs.  Though, I wouldn't trust the
pseudo-random number generator in most calculators; most of them are pretty
horrid.

As soon as we have some time, I'm trying to get a comp sci friend
to write a rotating map display of the 100 stars nearest to Earth.
A user should be able to alter and write in information on a star,
add jumplines/frequent travel routes, and so forth. Factual data
on star names, stellar type, mass, and luminosity will be included
so someone with a reasonable knowledge of physics can determine
biozones of stars for realistic colony placement.

Then again, maybe it'll turn out to be a pipe dream or I'll get
distracted by a different game system.

I'm doing something like this for a game that I'm playing in.  Our sectors are 20
parsec cubes divided into 8 10 parsec cube subsectors. Right now we've only got
stellar locations and classifications of 93 systems, of which, we only have planetary
data on 6.

This can be done using matrix math but you should restrict your search (1000 x 1000
matrices are rather computationally expensive).  Presumably, you've got your distance
calculations in a matrix.  Then filter through them.IF(distance < max_jump, 1 , 0)
this will yield a matrix that tells you which systems are within ONE max_jump of each
other.
Then you matrix multiply that matrix by itself to get the systems that are within TWO
max_jumps.
Then you matrix multiply the resulting matrix by the original to get the THREE
max_jumps table.
Continue multiplying until the two systems are connected.

I HIGHLY recommend you restrict your search matrix as much as possible before doing
this.  Otherwise your computer will explode :-)

The problem is the shear volume that 100 parsecs generates. 100x100 = 10000 possible
starsthe distance matrix would be 100,000,000 cells and you'd have to multiply that
by itself at least 25 times.

If you can reduce the search to a 10 x 10 x 100 path you've already cut out 90% of
the calculations.  There's probably a variation of the quicksort algorithm that can
speed this along even faster.

        You might want to extend your range a bit: excluding multiples
and all stars outside the range K->F, of the 65 stars closest to Sol,
five might be candidates (And apparently either Epsilon Indi or Epsilon
Eridani is a very young system).

I was just going to pick and choose manually where I wanted a colony.
I have a decent idea of what stars are good for approximately
terrestrial-type life, and just automatically eliminating some
multiple stars (Alpha Centauri comes to mind in particular)
overlooks the possibility that relatively distant binary and multiple
star systems can have planets and, if the stars are right, even
life. Young systems are something to keep in mind, but if they're
much over 500 million years old, you could get away with terraforming
some of their planets.

I wouldn't. At least not unless you have very liberal FTL drives in
your game. Astrologicus makes this assumption, which reduces its
general utility, IMO.

The first reason is that while K5 (or less)V and MV type stars tend to
tidal-lock anything in their biozone, if you suppose that
methane/ammonia breathing/metabolizing lifeforms are possible, then
they would be outside of what would be a habitable biozone for
carbon/water based oxygen breathing lifeforms. In our system, their
biozone would be about where the asteroid belt is. In a K or M
systems, planets thaat might support these types of "cold" lifeforms
would still be possible.

The second reason is that while planets around type M stars in the
biozone are likely to be tidal-locked, there might still be satellites
that might harbor life. I say this with tepridation, however, because
the same gravitational effects that cause tidal locking might preclude
satellites... you notice venus and mercury have no satelites.

The third reason is that as you mention, a large number of systems in
the near vicinity are not likely to support life. The only reasoble
means of expansion of human life into the universe would involve using
a "macrolife" approach until we have VERY efficient means of crossing
the gap. Macrolife is merely the notion that colonies will not
nescassarily be other planets, but colony stations floating in space.

Hey... that is what we're doing! Actually, not quite, but close. I'm
thinking 10 parsec on a side sectors divided into 5 parsec on a side
subsector. That keeps the information managable, and, as an added
bonus, Aina "Stargen" program generates 10-parsec on a side cubes (or
30 parsec on a side... which is A LOT of stars.)

If you assume a density in a cluster similar to nearby space, there
are about 5 systems in every 100 cubic parsecs. In a 5x5x5 pc cube,
that is 6 or so systems. In a 10x10x10 cube, that's around 50 systems,
which I find to be a manable number.

Well, you're just calling our subsectors your sectors. There's 8x10x16 = 1280 parsecs in a
Traveller (planar) sector. That's about 11 parsecs cubed... now if there was some way to
map the planar grid into 3d space...  I think its possible, there are 6 hexes around every
hex on the planar map and there are 6 orthogonal parsecs around a cube.

That's about right we've got 93 systems in 2 10 parsec cubesanyway check this out.  I'm

I'm using 100x100x100 parsec cubes. That's a heck of a lot of stars
(500,000 odd), but then I set the probability of a world suitable for
human habitation at about 0.0015%, leaving 750 suitable worlds, of which
about 5% have actually been colonised so far.

I think your numbers are off a little... there are about 50 stars per
100 cubic parsecs in the region around our sun, not 5. But if you're
talking about planetary systems (which in fact is what you said, so I
can't really fault you), well, you *may* be right... but we just don't
know how many systems there are out there yet. At some point you have to
fudge the numbers to whatever you want.

No, his figure is right, about one system per 20 cubic parsecs. Maybe
you dropped a decimal point somewhere?

Well, I said systems and I meant systems, because a system can be two
or more stars... the exact number of stars was less relevant in the
generation and mapping process than the number of systems.

My initial approximation was actually a quick and dirty one using a
cube containing nearby systems. If I do a spherical approximation,
there are, according to my sources (Audubon's Field Guide to the Stars
and Planets), 15 star systems  within 11.25 ly (3.45 parsecs.). That
is about 8 or 9 systemss per 100 cubic parsecs. Not that far off of my
guestimate of 5 per 100 cubic parsecs. 

Perhaps you thought I meant "in a 100x100x100 cube"? That is not 100
cubic parsecs. Or perhaps you were including Brahe objects - I
wouldn't do that myself - trying to add those to a map of stars would
be an exercise in irrelevance.

   How does one make a readable 3D starmap?  I've had some experience
in this area.  Several years ago I created a map for a conquer-the-
universe game I wanted to design.  I took the 59 closest star systems
to Sol (and Sol itself) and drew up a 2D map showing their 3D
positions -- every system was a small circle on the map.  I then
compared the distances from each system to every other system, and
drew a line between all systems that were a certain minimum distance
away from each other.  The lines showed what trips were possible given
the game's jump technology.
   A few things that could be done to make the map more readable and
easier to understand:

1. Color-code the jump lines based on importance of the route.  One
color could represent routes taken by regular commercial passenger and
freight carriers.  Another could be routes that have no regular
service, but that are still possible to travel.  This gives players a
good idea of where they can go and how they need to get there.
2.  Vary the sizes of the circles for the star systems.  Larger
circles are systems that are "higher" in the Z dimension of the map,
and successive smaller ones are "lower."  This makes it easier for
players to visualize the third dimension.
3. Eliminate jump lines that (on the map) pass through a system
circle, which further improves the map's readability.  The
justification here is that there's a nebula, dust cloud, ionic storm,
or whatever that prevents direct travel between those two systems.  If
you don't want such things in your campaign then turn those straight
lines into gently curved ones.
4. When you make another "subsector" map that is adjacent to the first
one consider what systems would be linked together between them and
draw arrows to indicate this on both maps for each mutual connection.
5. The randomization process that you used may give you systems that
are inconveniently close together, which might make it difficult to
lay down all the routes that should be there.  Feel free to move those
circles a little to make it easier to draw everything.  However, don't
change the actual numeric positions and distances; just the circles in
the map's two dimensions -- the map will still have accurate routes.

   Using this system one could create a cubical area of space holding
up to perhaps 100 star systems and all of their names and routes.  A
Car Wars blank arena map works well.  Even if you don't actually run
the campaign you'll still have an attractive wall decoration.
   But what if a smartass player wants to jump to deep space where
there are no systems or routes that you've so carefully laid out?
Hand him the distances and a calculator and let /him/ figure it out!

   My own map showed a /spherical/ area of space, but the concepts
work the same for a cubical area.  I used options 2, 3, and 5; 1 and 4
didn't apply for that particular game design.  I still have that map
lying around somewhere. . .

I had an earlier version of my 3d map where I color coded the jumproutes by length. Going from blue
to red depending on the portion of the ship's fuel would be used up. This ended up being a horrible
mass of lines, so I restricted it to charted routes.

I set the color and size of the stars based on their stellar classification

I'm currently working on my sector sized (20 pc cube), subsector  sized (10 pc cube) and local
(jumpable) maps.  The jump distance maps have the system names included for easier reference.

In our game, we might have to do that.  Our FTL drive has two speeds, charted and exploration.
Going at charted speed we can cover 30 pc in a day, at exploration speed we can cover 1 pc in 3
days.  Fuel limits us to about 3.7 parsecs exploring... so we can span a gap by charting out 3
parsecs, jumping back for refueling, then jumping back to continue exploration. Its easy enough to
enter the data into my database, but reforming the maps could take a little while.
Here's a sample

No... I got that right.

No. I think maybe I just stuffed up somewhere. :-)  Oh well, it hardly
matters for campaign purposes if I have 50 per 100 cubic parsecs and
0.0015% "human-suitable" world rate, or 5 per 100 cubic parsecs and
0.015% rate.

BTW: that star position/distance spreadsheet I'm working on is quickly
becoming very campaign-specific. I'm not sure it will be that much
use to anyone else, unless you want to distill the formulae out of it
and plug in your own data.

     How much of the formulae is campaign-specific? If it's merely a
matter of determining how many stars per area, how big an area, and how
prevalent life is, then no problem. Just make it possile to enter
numbers for those variables in a few cells.
     If it's much more complicated than that, then tailoring it for easy
translation is problematic.

For some factual data: there are exactly 100 stars within 21 light-years
of Earth in any direction, including Sol (and I can list them, but
I'd prefer to give a reference if you can't find any astronomy
website with the right data). A 21 light-year radius sphere
is a 38,792 cybic light-year sphere. That puts 1 star every 387
cubic light-years. A parsec being 3.26 light-years in length,
there are 34.6 cubic light-years per cubic parsec or...

1 star every 11.19 cubic parsecs. 1 per 20 is a ballpark figure,
especially if someone's dropping decimal places.

I think you're confusing *stars* with *systems*. Within 21 light-years,
there are 110 individual stars (my figures must be more recent than
yours), but only 88 star systems.

For some more factual data...

A good online source for this sort of thing is NASA's Astronomical Data
Centre, at http://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ <http://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov/>

The definitive catalogue of nearby stars is Gliese and Jahreiss's Third
Catalogue of Nearby Stars (1991; catalogue 5070A in the ADC). It lists
every known star out to 25 parsecs (81 light-years). (Caveat: it mostly
lists individual stars rather than systems, and needs some careful
analysis to work out exactly which stars belong together.)

Here are some statistics:

  Distance     Star     Individual  Cubic light-years  Cubic parsecs
  light-years  systems  stars       per system         per system
  10           8        12          524                15.1
  20           76       105         441                12.7
  30           213      287         531                15.3
  40           464      601         578                16.6
  50           884      1127        592                17.1
  60           1427     1775        634                18.3
  70           2110     2602        681                19.6
  80           2767     3401        775                22.3

At larger distances, the statistics can't be trusted beacuse dim stars
are undercounted; at very short distances, the numbers are too small for
reliable statistics. The figures at intermediate distances seem to be
around 550-600 cubic light-years (16-17 cubic parsecs) per system.

        I thought the Hipparcos data were in, making Gliese's list

I was counting individual stars. The list breaks down systems into
star-by-star entries. If there's 110 stars within 21 light-years of
Earth instead of 100 like I claimed, then our sources are probably
fudging exactly what falls within 21 light-years to different degrees.
As mine was boiled down from several sources before being put into
the book I was looking at, I'd expect mine is in error.

Funnily enough, since being made unexpectedly redundant earlier this
week, I've been working on updating my near-star map from Gliese 3 to
Hipparcos. (Hey, you got to do something besides looking for a new job,
right?)

I've done this once before, when I originally did a map based on Gliese
2 and updated it to Gliese 3. Now, you might think that things aren't
going to change much between 1975 and 1991 (or 1991 to 1998), just a bit
more refined positioning. (After all, even zippy halo stars like Wolf
424 only travel a light-year per millenium relative to us.)

Turns out not to be the case. Some stars' positions are based on very
little observational data. When observed more closely, some nearby red
dwarves turn out to be faraway red giants, for example, and vice versa.
Several stars disappeared between Gliese 2 and Gliese 3, from the point
of view of a map 20 l.y. across. For example, if you look at the map
from GDW's 2300 A.D. which was based on Gliese 2, you will see an orange
star called Queen Alice's Star. Try as I might, I could never find a K
class anywhere near that position in Gliese 3.

I don't have the figures with me now, but just comparing the data I
found about a half-dozen new stars within 20 ly. The Hipparcos catalogue
doesn't give alternative catalogue names for these or even spectral
class, so they must be newly observed with Hipparcos. On the other hand,
there are a lot of stars and a lot of catalogues, so they may be listed
somewhere. I'll have a better idea when I draw the new map.

Also, Hipparcos had an observational limit of about 12th magnitude, so
outside of a very few light-years, red dwarves were invisible to it. Not
very much further out, K class dwarves disappear, and even a G dwarf
similar to Sol is lost at about 40 parsecs. 

So, the short answer is: Hipparcos isn't the last word in near-space
mapping. You still need Gliese 3 to fill in the gaps. And even Gliese has 
gaps. "All known stars to 30 parsecs" isn't the same as "All stars to
30 parsecs".

Sorry to go on in such detail, but I don't have a lot to do right now.
Does anyone know if that Mac Guru job at SJ Games is still open? I could
do with a change of scenery.... :)

Okay, I'll admit that the talk of hexes and Starmaps threw me into a kind
of atavistic flashback to SPI's 'StarForce: Alpha Centauri' (circa 1975) which 
had one of these charts.

But on the other telekinetic lobe, some people even now don't have calculators
(let alone computers with spreadsheet programs), some people don't use them, 
and some people are just too disnumerate to handle stuff like H=sqr(x^2 + y^2 
+ z^2) as a one-step calculation. Yes, even some sf fans, *even* some sfrpg 
players. It isn't a design sin to provide a simpler route.

Yeah, but your players aren't going to be taking all 2211 journeys. The
solution should be pretty similar to Traveller's mapping: Make one pass
assigning starport grades. Work out distances between 1st grade
starports, linking them together with trade routes; any segment of the
route that's longer than, say, jump 4 instead breaks to a 2nd or 3rd
grade port.

Work out *basic* stats for all 67 of your worlds. Figure where your
players' home base will be, and write that planet up fully. Write up all
the worlds on trade routes with a bit less detail. Write up any
adventure target worlds. Write up some generic backwater (umm, hinder
stars?) worlds, e.g. mining colony, religious community, swamp-world,
ice-planet, etc. Don't forget, a certain proportion of your 67 stars are
going to be without planets and others are going to have just snowballs
and rocks with nothing worth exploiting and therefore nothing going on.

Encourage, persuade or bribe players to stick to the trade routes. Any
time they wander off, get *them* to work out the distances and how
they're going to get there. When they get there, tell them there's
nothing there, or pull out a generic world, or start an adventure seed
to one of your adventure targets or back to a trade-route world.

You can't create a whole universe and know everything about it, and your
players shouldn't expect you to. Aim for verisimilitude, not
encyclopedic detail. Make certain things arbitrarily difficult for the
players, like exploring stuff you haven't mapped. When all else fails,
make stuff up. When that doesn't work, get *them* to make it up.

Remember when Traveller Adventure No 1 came out? (Probably not, since
I'm an old fart.) Kinunir had one lousy subsector mapped with nearly no
explanation. No map of the Spinward Marches. No map of the Imperium, no
goddamed library data, even. My group didn't understand a thing about
GDW's universe, so we made it up, and had a great time doing it. Lousy time
trying to get it to fit to GDW's history as it revealed itself, though.

Ah, those were the days....

star called Queen Alice's Star. Try as I might, I could never find a K
class anywhere near that position in Gliese 3.

I don't have the figures with me now, but just comparing the data I
found about a half-dozen new stars within 20 ly. Hipparcos doesn't give
alternative catalogue names for these or even spectral class, so they
must be newly observed with Hipparcos. On the other hand, there are a
lot of stars and a lot of catalogues, so they may be listed somewhere.
I'll have a better idea when I draw the new map.

Also, Hipparcos had an observational limit of about 12th magnitude, so
outside of a very few light-years, red dwarves were invisible to it. Not
very much further out, K class dwarves disappear, and even a G dwarf
similar to Sol is lost at about 40 parsecs. 

So, the short answer is: Hipparcos isn't the last word in near-space
mapping. You still need Gliese 3 to fill in the gaps.

Sorry to go on in such detail, but I don't have a lot to do right now.
Does anyone know if that Mac Guru job at SJ Games is still open? I could
do with a change of scenery.... :)

BTW, you can check out my old Gliese 3 map on Winchell Chung's site at:

Yes, but nobody's produced a new near-star list from the Hipparcos/Tycho
catalogues yet. Until someone does, Gliese 1991 is the best we have for
now.

If anyone's thinking of downloading the Hipparcos data and trying it,
there are two things you should keep in mind. First, the Hipparcos
catalogues are magnitude-limited; just listing the nearest stars from
them won't give you a complete list (you'll need to merge the Gliese
data). Second, the complete catalogue is 120 megabytes :-)

Well, there is a page with an "unofficial" B5 map on it. Couldn't tell
you the URL right off the top of my head, but I'll see if I can find
it and get back to you.

  It is, and its available on http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/Cats.html <http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/Cats.html>.

I don't know how accurate the data in the Babylon Project (the roleplaying
game book) is, but you may want to check out "Stellar Geography in the
Babylon 5 Galaxy" at <http://www.math.washington.edu/~lking/epsilon3.html <http://www.math.washington.edu/~lking/epsilon3.html>>
for a discussion of the relationship between real astronomy and the variou
stars mention in the show.

Hope this helps.

Regards,

Zoran
