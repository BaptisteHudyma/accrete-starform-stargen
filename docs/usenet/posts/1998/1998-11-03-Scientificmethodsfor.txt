TITLE: 'Scientific' methods for solar system generation 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tuesday, 3 November 1998 08:00:00 UTC - Tom Ford:
I'm searching for some algorythums based on at least a little science which
will generator solar systems. The most up-to-date one I have come across
so far is circa 1979, which I feel may be a little out of date.
It's for a game, as you may have guessed; we plan to have planets and moons
and stations all orbiting each other, done Newtonianly.

Although we plan to simulate binary/tertairy etc. systems, I doubt if there
are scientific methods deal with the solar systems of these (since to my
albeit limited knowledge no planets in such systems have been found).

Thanks for your time.

Tom,

  Regardless of whether or not examples of binary or ternary systems
with planets have been found and examined, we fully expect that
Newton's law of gravitation will hold in such cases.  Thus, it is
possible to simulate such systems.  You need to look for some solar
system simulation codes for inspiration.  If arcsecond accuracy is not
required (this is a game, right?) then a simple leap-frog algorithm
will suffice.  For starters, pull down JACK.BAS from

  http://www.skypub.com/software/softwar2.shtml <http://www.skypub.com/software/softwar2.shtml>

and take a close look at how it works.

Thanks for your advice; on second reading my post was a little vague.
What I'm actually looking for is an algorythum which will create a solar
system; ie. start with a star then project what types and sizes of planets
will be created as the star cools, their positions, masses, composition etc.

Theoretically I am a physics undergraduate so I hope I should be able to
calculate the equations and physics of actually orbitting under gravity
myself :)

Tom,

  Since there is no definitive, universally agreed upon mechanism for 
solar system formation, let alone mathematically codified algorithms for
predicting planet formation, you're going to have a bit of trouble here.
I have seen references to simulations being done, making use of best
guesses for initial conditions, making assumptions about the relative
importance of the processes involved (gravitation vs magneto-fluid
dynamics for example).

  It's possible to obtain very plausible results using fairly 
straightforward simulations.  One example that I remember well was 
published in a newsletter called 'The Orrery', issue 13.  You might be 
able to obtain that back issue from the newsletter's editor/publisher, 
Caxton Foster.  A web page to look at for more information is:

  http://www.capecod.net/~cfoster1/caxton.htm <http://www.capecod.net/~cfoster1/caxton.htm>



Best of Luck,

Wow!  Must've changed overnight!  Here's the new one:

One thing that should get you started is ACCRETE.  Unfortunately, the
one page I knew that was about it and had it available for downloaded
has expired, but you should be able to find it somewhere on the web with
some web searches.

Yeah, that's the programme I have got. I was rather hoping there was
something more up to date (prehistoric C in the code I have, anyway).

Excellent link, troughed most of them already for future use. :)))

        ACCRETE isn't bad, as far as it goes. If you want a more detailed
simulation, look up "Silicon Creation" (in the library, Journal of the
British Interplanetary Society, author Martyn Fogg). He extended Dole's
ACCRETE code a bit. No code, but good interesting descriptions and
plenty of references.
        I've been trying to write a better version of ACCRETE, but I'm afraid I
got bogged down in the details (I think they may be a slight bug in the
version running around the net, which probably means I don't understand
it well enough yet.

        First, I apologize for posting before researching.
        Second, here's some references:

        Fogg, Martyn J. "Extra-Solar Planetary Systems: A Microcomputer 
           Simulation". JBIS V38, 501-514, 1985.
        Fogg, "Terraforming, as part of a strategy for interstellar 
           colonization", JBIS V44, p183, 1991
        Fogg, "An Estimate of the Prevalence of Biocompatible and Habitable 
           Planets", JBIS V45, pp.3-12, 1992

        There is also a guy (on the web) who has worked out a home-computer
simulation based on Wetherill's method of planetismals (perhaps more
realistic). I know longer have his URL, but his name is Kevin Sagarsee.
I never did reproduce his code, but it might be interesting.
        The real problem is that the formation of the solar system (at least
down to the details level you might like) is not fully understood (or at
least agreed upon).
