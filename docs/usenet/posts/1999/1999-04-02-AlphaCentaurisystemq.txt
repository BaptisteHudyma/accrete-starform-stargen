TITLE: Alpha Centauri system question 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Friday, 2 April 1999 09:00:00 UTC+1 - Dan Goodman:
Is it safe to assume that the Alpha Centauri system contains (or can
contain) stuff equivalent to Trans-Neptunian Objects?  (Regardless of
whether there's anything larger and/or closer in?)

Um, no.

The C of G will be of constant velocity (except for accelerations of gravity 
from bodies EXTERNAL to the system).  That's what a center of gravity (or, 
better, a center of mass) does.

Also, I believe that the periods of the stars around each other is quite long.

Even so, I would second our local superhero's guess that this would make the 
more distant orbits less stable.

I've heard from unofficial sources that it was decided that Proxima
definitely wasn't bound to the system, but I haven't seen any references
to back that up yet.

The center of gravity of a system in isolation _by definition_ moves in
a straight line.

If you're talking about the center of mass of the A-B system, then, yes,
as Proxima passes by, the center of mass of the other two stars is going
to describe an hyperbola, but it's going to be a pretty shallow curve,
since Proxima is so far away (about 1/6 ly = 11 000 au = 1.6 Pm).

A is G2 V and B is K0 V.  Their true orbit has an eccentricity of about
0.5, which makes their distances vary roughly from 10 au (2 Tm) to 40 au
(6 Tm).

When you have binar star systems, if you want to have planets, then then
you basically only have two options:  1. both stars close together, with
the planetary system far away; 2. both stars far away, with the
planetary systems huddled around each star.

Such an eccentric orbit between the two probably precludes any really
interesting planets in the mix.  I doubt a planet at ~1 au would be
stable, and to have stable planets far away, they'd need to have _huge_
orbits.

Alpha Centauri probably does not have any interesting planets, but it
probably has an Oort cloud.  Whether or not it has something like a
Kuiper belt is up for grabs, but I don't see why you could have one
(placed at, say, 100 au).

There was an article a few years ago:

"Is Proxima really in orbit about Alpha Cen A/B?":

http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1993MNRAS.261L...5M&db_key=AST&high=36a4d29ba903927

or

http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/rajm/proxima.htm <http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/rajm/proxima.htm>

I remember a followup article that stated that Proxima was probably bound,
but just barely.

It's also worth noting that Proxima Centauri appears to have a companion,
although whether it's a planet or a brown dwarf (or not there are all!)
remains to be seen.

Momentum is conserved.  If there are no external forces acting on a
system, then the momentum of that system is constant -- that is, the
center of mass of the system moves in a straight line (or does not
move).

Gravity is a conservative force field, and so it conserves momentum and
energy.  The center of mass of a closed system (of arbitrarily many
bodies) thus has no forces on it, and moves in a straight line (or, as I
said, doesn't move at all).

The recent discoveries of extrasolar planets, for instance, work by
looking at wobbling of the _star_ (i.e., one body, not the center of
mass of the whole system).  Maybe that's what you were thinking of.

Most of you should be able to read the abstract.  Only certain users at
university sites will be able to download the article.

For the inner system of Alpha Centauri, they get a critical distance from A
of 2.79AU and for B of 2.54AU. Particles within this distance remained
stable during their simulation. They also calculate
an OUTER limit (where the planet orbits both stars), which, I think, is what
the original poster wants.

No word therin on whether planets could actually form in such a system, but
this blows holes in many people's assumptions about where stable planetary
orbits can exist.

My memory is a little fuzzy here - but isn't this large enough for the
orbit of *Mars* to be stable?

The peace of God be with you.

Thanx, IIRC Stephen Dole in his seminal "Habitable Planets for Man" (1964) did
a similar analysis.  IIRC the numbers for stable planetary orbits weren't quite
that high, but then he probably only had a slide rule even if he was working
for RAND at the time.

Re-read the post.  Objects remained in stable orbits with a distance of 2.79
AU for A, and 2.54 AU for B.  That means Mars, or some planet-like object
with a distance of 1.52 AU, *would* be in a stable orbit.

I would imagine Alpha Centauri would have a pretty huge asteroid belt
(belts?).

.  Mars' major axis is 1.52 AU, well under  2.54.  Ceres, in the 
asteroind belt, is at 2.8 AU.

Ah, I guess it depends on what is meant by "within".  If they meant "less
than or up to this distance" then you're right.  If they meant "at or around
this distance" then you're wrong.

It also depends on the timescales over which those orbits are stable.  A
few million years won't cut it.

The abstract is very intriguing. Unfortunately, I'm one of the many who
cannot access the full article. I'm working a solar system-generator based
on the old accrete program. One of the options is to generate systems based
on the systems that Dole listed as the most likely to have habitable
planets. The list includes several binary systems, and I'd like to limit the
generated planets to the stable orbits. I've plugged in the numbers listed
here for Alpha Centauri, but I'd love to have figures for the rest of them.
Can anyone provide the data for any of the following?

    70 Ophiuchi A
    Eta Cassiopeiae A
    36 Ophiuchi A
    36 Ophiuchi B
    HR7703 A
    HR753 A
