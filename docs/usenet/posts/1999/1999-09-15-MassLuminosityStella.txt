   Thanks for another good reference. But now I've got *five* different
mass/luminosity relationships to go on, and still no clue. Putting them
all in (roughly) the same form*, they are:

An empirical fit by McCluskey & Kondo, 1972 [for M > 0.2 Ms]:
L = 1.202 ( M ^ 3.8 )

An empirical fit by Harris et.al <http://et.al>., 1963 [approximate]
L = M ^ 4    if L > Ls
  = M ^ 2.8  if L < Ls

L = M ^ 3.8

Fit provided by you (from Moran's book):
L = 0.4365 ( M ^ 2.6 )  if M < 0.5 Ms
  =          M ^ 3.8    if 0.5 Ms < M < 2.5 Ms
  = 3.1623 ( M ^ 2.5 )  if M > 2.5 Ms

Equation used by Martyn Fogg [for zero age main sequence stars; only
quoted as valid up to 2.0 Ms anyway]:
L = 0.71 ( M ^ n )
   n = 3.75 M + 2.125  for M < 0.7 Ms
   n = 4.75            for M > 0.7 Ms

While I'm inclined to go with your's, (and see no reason to accept the
1963 approximate relationship over the others), I am curious as to the
constraints on this. I realize perhaps the difference is just in the
data, but does anyone know of any relationships that claim to talk about
zero-age main sequence stars, and specificly how the luminosity changes
as they age, as well as their expected lifespans on the main sequence?
From Fogg, I have:

L = Lz exp[ 0.045 (10 t / Tms )^1.33 ]
   Lz = zero age main sequence luminosity (one of the above?)
   t = age of star
   Tms = main sequence lifetime of star
       = 10 ( M ^ (1-n) )     (where n is defined above)

But this is about *all* I have, and Fogg's equations specificly excluded
massive 2 Ms and above) stars, so I don't trust them too far.

* putting them all in the same form BTW was probably the best learning
experience for me. Why are they presented in so many different ways?

Actually, the luminosity increases significantly (by ~25% as I recall)
as the star consumes H in its core.  Most lifetimes are generally only
timescales, anyway.

   Well, actually (according to everything I've read) it doesn't, and
that's (probably) part of my problem. Gradually a star increases in
luminosity, surface temperature, and radius during it's time on the main
sequence. The Sun probably started out around 30% dimmer (and will
finish almost twice as bright) as it is now, all while still on the main
sequence.
   And I suspect that's part of the problem I'm having: the zero-age
main sequence luminosity won't be the same as the empirically observed
luminosities, due to aging (as well as different masses aging at
different rates, and the fact that low-mass stars haven't been around
long enough to have any "aged" examples present (the galaxy is too
young)).

[snip otherwise reasonable BotE calculation]

> T_hr = 7,2 * 10^9 a  * (m / m_o) ^2

   The dependance on the mass (m^2, in your example) seems wrong; it
implies that massive stars should live longer than low-mass ones, which
is not the case.

Hi there...!

From what I can see, you are looking for several qualities of HRD
main-sequence stars.
(Hope that's true otherwise this has only been an excercise in typing...:)
An empirical mass/luminosity-relationship in first approximation is:


L / L_o = (m / m_o) ^ a
L     : Luminosity of star
L_o : Luminosity of sun
m    : Mass of star
m_o: Mass of sun

a     :  I've found values for  a  between 3.0 and 3.5 (depends on where you
place your tangent...)

Mass/radius-relationship:

R / R_o = ( m / m_o ) ^ 0.6

R, R_o : Radius star / sun


Time on main sequence:

Since luminosity  L remains constant during the main-sequence-phase T_hr,
the star burns the

energy W = L * T_hr

Hydrogen-fusion produces about 6.13*10^14 J from 1kg H.
If one assumes 70% (average percentage in sun's photoshere) of the star's
mass to be Hydrogen, then that amounts to the energy

W = 6,13*10^14 (J/kg) * 0,07 * m = 0,43*10^14 (J/kg)

So the time on the m-s becomes:

T_hr = 0,43*10^14 (J/kg) * m / L

And that thrown into the mass/luminosity-relation gives


T_hr = 7,2 * 10^9 a  * (m / m_o) ^2
a          : years
m,m_o : Mass star, sun


And finally a table showing some values for stars with the same chemical
composition as the sun:

Spectral type:    O5  |    B0   |    A0   |    F0    |   G0   |    K0   |
M0
m/m_o          :    50   |   18    |   3,2    |   1,8    |   1,1   |    0,8
|    0,5
T_hr/years    :   3e6  |   2e7   |   7e8   |   2e9   |    6e9  |   1e10 |
3e10

e6 : 10^6 (for sake of space...)

The large difference in the age of main-sequence-stars leads to the
conclusion that there are still stars being born...

Hope this helps a bit...

BTW: I have this stuff from two german textbooks on astronomy
(Weigert/Wendker "Astronomy and Astrophysics",
Gondolatsch/Steinacker/Zimmermann "Astronomy") and my notes from Prof.
deBoer, Bonn, Germany.

Indeed there isn't.  A log-log graph is not a straight line, so it's not
simply a y = x^a, where a is a constant.  a is also a function of x.

Oops! Typo-alert!!!!
it is     m^  - 2 !!!!!
But before we go any further:
could you please tell me what exactly you are looking for, since this might make things a
bit easier (and I don't have rec.arts.sf.science on my news-server, so I can't read the

Nitpick: It's Stephen Maran. He's written quite a few popular

Sources quoted in various postings seem to give values ranging from 2.5
to 4.8. And also seem to indicate that "a" varies with mass. 

If a *does* vary with mass, we need *that* function. <sigh>

  When I used the 3.5 power formula, the results I got were nowhere near
given masses and luminosities of nearby stars.  I did a regression 
analysis using data on about 30 nearby stars given in an astronomy book, 
and got L=( M/Msun)^4.34.  Obviously most of these stars were less 
massive than the sun. I think the formula I gave you earlier, based on 
"The Astronomy and Astrophysics Encyclopedia", published in 1990, and 
presumably having better data, gives
results most closely matching the real universe.
Using the above formulas for initial luminosity, Gillette's LZAMS 
equations can still be used to get the relative increase in luminosity 
over time, but as I said before, they overestimate the luminosity of 
stars more massive than the Sun.

   Which is why I initally liked Fogg's version; here, the exponent does
vary with mass in a simple way (as oppossed to a bunch of patched
together power laws, it's a little easier to calculate). but Fogg's
version is limited to 2 Msolar or less (and it has problems, it seems,
even there).
   So I guess if I want accuracy, I use a patched function. <sigh>

   Although the equations you gave overestimate the Lzams significantly
(after all, they yield L=1 for M=1, which is *not* the case for a
zero-age population). So I've got to (at least) uniformly scale the
luminosities down so that L=0.71 when M=1.

a does indeed vary with mass... it depends on how much of the entire
curve is used in the fitting.  For sunlike stars, it is mildly different
than for much bigger stars or much smaller ones, and for brown dwarfs
the dependence is very nonlinear because you are close to a cutoff.

Many nearby stars are not on the main sequence... it is good to remember
that.

The best thing to do is take a published curve for zero-age or evolved
main sequence... or just the (thicker) observed main sequence, and fit
to that.  What I would do is fit the upper and lower parts of the curve
separately and then use a roll-over for the transition.  Use your
favorite method...  you'll need at least a calculator anyway.

L=1 for M=1 at age zero. Obviously the sun is older than age 0, and when
you plug in the LZAM formula, as you said, the luminosity of the sun is
now about 1.4.
Incidentally, you'll also have to adjust for initial composition of the
stellar material.  Martin Schwarzschild, in "Structure and Evolution of 
the Stars" gives
Luminosity is proportional to k^8.06.
 where k= 1/(2X + 3/4 Y + 1/2 Z)
where X= fraction of hydrogen in star by % at age zero,
      Y= fraction of helium in star by % at age zero,
      Z= fraction of heavier elements by% at age zero.
Tha book was published in 1958, so maybe new date have ruined this 
theoretical model.
