TITLE: Star-system formation/generation (was: A planets temperature)

Hi, and back again !
Ok, i think a small introduction whould be convinient.

I'd like to code a program/library which describes/creates
a starsystem either from a simple morgan-keenan classification
or from an accrete-like subroutine.

First the morgan-keenan aspect:

   spectral-types (O,B,A,F,G,K,M,R,N,S [0-9]):

      i think that some types (R,N,S) are no longer in use, but
      i'd like to know what they were originally standing for,
      somebody?

      is it possible to establish surface temperatures from
      these values only ?

   luminosity-classes (Ia,Ib,IIa,II,III,IV,V,VI,VII):

      V is mainsequence, right ?

      can i establish some base masses from the classes
      above and modify them with the spectral-types to
      determine their actual mass, say "A M3III star
      has ?? times the mass of sol" ?

   more general questions:

      has someone mass-luminosity equations for other
      startypes than main-sequence ?

      how can i differenciate the various stars based
      on margan-keenan, to apply these equations ?


more to follow, if these questions are answered to my satisfaction.
