TITLE: worldbuilding: Gillett's spectral types table?!? 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tuesday, 14 September 1999 08:00:00 UTC+1 - Brian Davis:
Has anyone been able to reproduce (from equations, references, etc.)
the table in the back of Gillett's "Worldbuilding" book? On page 178 he
list some properties of main sequence stars - but the mass/luminosity
relationship does not agree with the equations I have, specificly:
   L = 0.71 M^n  ,  where n = 3.75 M/Ms  +  2.125  if  0.1<M<0.7
                          n = 4.75                 if  0.7<M<2.0

Additionally, he seems to exrapolate beyond the limits of the equation I
mention anyway. I have some of the same problems with Gillett's
estiamtions of MS lifetimes, to wit his figures from the table don't
mesh well with the equation:

   Tms = 10 M^(1-n)  ,   [in Gy]

Any help here?!? Looking at Gillett's reference doesn't help much, as
his table doesn't seem to agree with them (and he even says
"recalculated from" such-and-such reference).

   Help! I'm convinced the error is mine, but I can find it. Has anybody
else thrown this table into Excel and tried to reproduce his figures?
Anyone?

You're right;  Gillette's formula seems to work okay for dwarf stars, but 
it overestimates the luminosities of stars more massive than the sun.
The formula given by the "Astronomy and Astrophysics Encyclopedia", 
edited by Stephen P. Moran gives

Log L= 2.6 Log Mass - 0.36 for stars under 0.5 Mass sun.

Log L= 3.8 Log Mass for stars between 0.5 and 2.5 Mass sun.

Log L= 2.6 Log Mass +0.5 for stars over 2.5 Mass sun

   Thanks for another good reference. But now I've got *five* different
mass/luminosity relationships to go on, and still no clue. Putting them
all in (roughly) the same form*, they are:

An empirical fit by McCluskey & Kondo, 1972 [for M > 0.2 Ms]:
L = 1.202 ( M ^ 3.8 )

An empirical fit by Harris et.al <http://et.al>., 1963 [approximate]
L = M ^ 4    if L > Ls
  = M ^ 2.8  if L < Ls

L = M ^ 3.8

Fit provided by you (from Moran's book):
L = 0.4365 ( M ^ 2.6 )  if M < 0.5 Ms
  =          M ^ 3.8    if 0.5 Ms < M < 2.5 Ms
  = 3.1623 ( M ^ 2.5 )  if M > 2.5 Ms

Equation used by Martyn Fogg [for zero age main sequence stars; only
quoted as valid up to 2.0 Ms anyway]:
L = 0.71 ( M ^ n )
   n = 3.75 M + 2.125  for M < 0.7 Ms
   n = 4.75            for M > 0.7 Ms

While I'm inclined to go with your's, (and see no reason to accept the
1963 approximate relationship over the others), I am curious as to the
constraints on this. I realize perhaps the difference is just in the
data, but does anyone know of any relationships that claim to talk about
zero-age main sequence stars, and specificly how the luminosity changes
as they age, as well as their expected lifespans on the main sequence?
From Fogg, I have:

L = Lz exp[ 0.045 (10 t / Tms )^1.33 ]
   Lz = zero age main sequence luminosity (one of the above?)
   t = age of star
   Tms = main sequence lifetime of star
       = 10 ( M ^ (1-n) )     (where n is defined above)

But this is about *all* I have, and Fogg's equations specificly excluded
massive 2 Ms and above) stars, so I don't trust them too far.

* putting them all in the same form BTW was probably the best learning
experience for me. Why are they presented in so many different ways?

[Long quote retained for context.]

If his figures are different from his quoted reference, then he
obviously simply made a mistake.

Here's some more information:

_Stars and their spectra_, J.B. Kahler, p. 153:

    ... we find that the energy output of a main sequence star is very
    approximately proportional to the 3.5 power of its mass.

_An introduction to the theory of stellar structure_, S. Chandrasekhar
(yes, _the_ Chandrasekhar), p. 3 contains a M-L diagram which indicates
very roughly that high-mass stars (log M > ~1, log L > ~2) L goes as M,
whereas for lower mass stars (log M < ~1, log L < ~2) L goes as M^4.

_Principles of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis_, D.D. Clayton:

    ... the luminosity is proportional to a rather high power of the
    mass; that is, 

        L = const x M^nu [1-50]

    where nu lies in the range of 3.5 to 4.0. ... Basically Eq. [1-50]
    may be thought of as an approximation applicable to a class  called
    main-sequence stars.

_Stellar structure and evolution_, R. Kippenhahn, A. Weigert, p. 207-8:

    ... R increases slowly, and L increases strongly with increasing M. 
    For an interpolation over a certain range of M we may again write

        R ~ M^xi, L ~ M^eta.

    From the slopes of the curve in Fig. 22.2 [M-parameterized T-L
    diagram and M-R diagram for zero-age main sequence stars] we find
    roughly xi = 0.57 and 0.8 in the upper and lower mass rangess
    respectively.  In the range of small values of M, there is a
    pronounced maximum of the slope around M = 1 M_solar, indicating
    that a remarkable deviation from homologous behaviour in this range.
    ...
        Also the slope of the M-L relation in Fig 22.3 [M-L diagram]
    varies with M.  Over the whole mass range plotted [-1 < log
    (M/M_solar) < 1.5], the average of eta is about 3.2.  For M = (1 ..
    10) M_solar, the average exponent is 3.88, while in the larger range
    M = (1 .. 40) M_solar it is 3.35. ...

Finally, here's a [long] post I discovered I'd archived from Amara Graps
about this subject:

You may be interested in knowing that there is a deep theoretical
basis for the relationships between M, L, T, R of stars on the main
sequence that goes back almost a hundred years. It is the theory of
"polytropes" and the "Lane-Emden" equations. Chandrasekhar wrote quite
a bit about it in his book: _An Introduction to the Study of Stellar
Structure_ published in 1939 (look at Ch. 4: "Polytropic and
Isothermal Gas Spheres"). There, he refers to R. Emden's kinetic
theory work published in 1907. You will find that most current stellar
evolution astrophysics texts discuss it. See Clayton: _Principles of
Stellar Evolution and Nucleosynthesis_ (Chapter 2.4), Schwarzschild:
_Structure and Evolution of Stars_ (pg. 109) and Bowers and Deeming:
_Astrophysics I: Stars_ (pg.  60-61).

The polytrope theory looks at the limitations of the structure of a
star based on just the conditions of hydrostatic equilibrium. It
assumes a power-law relation between pressure P and density rho:

P = K rho^{1 + 1/n}

where K is constant and n is the polytropic index. Gaseous spheres in
which each point along the radius follow the above relationship are
called "polytropes."

Stellar models in which the polytropic index is constant from the
center to surface have played an important role in the development of
the theory of the stellar interior. (Polytropes have no physical
relevance unless n is really constant throughout the structure.)

The Lane-Emden equation is the following. Start with the simplest
equations of a quasi-static stellar model:

dP/dr = -G M rho/r^2

dM/dr = 4 pi r^2 rho

Combine and rewrite them compactly as:

1/r^2  d/dr(r^2/rho dP/dr) = -4 pi G rho

(P = pressure, G = gravitational constant, rho = density, r = radius, 
M = mass)

After substituting the P = K rho^{1 + 1/n} relationship and 
doing some normalizing, you get the Lane-Emden equation:

(Involves substituting rho/rho_0 = theta^n, P = K rho^{1 + 1/n} *
theta^{n+1}, r = alpha * xi, alpha = [((n + 1)K)/(4 pi G) * rho_0^{1/n
- 1}]^0.5 where xi and theta are renormalization variables)

1/xi^2 d/dxi(xi^2 dtheta/dxi) + theta^n = 0

The solution for theta as a function of xi completely determines the
structure of a polytrope (star under the above polytropic assumptions)
except for the choice of central density.

The polytropic index n is an important parameter in stellar modeling.
Convection in stars limits n to >= 1.5 The Sun can be characterized
somewhere between n = 2.5 and n = 3.

As it turns out, most main sequence stars can be conveniently well
characterized by polytropic index n = 3. You may find in the
literature Eddington's "quartic equation" or the "Eddington Standard
Model" which is based on the n = 3 parameter.

Some general notes of structural physical phenomena along the main
sequence. (my reference is some class notes by John Faulkner)

Whatever opacity or energy generation law, L increases with M. This
places massive stars at the upper end of the main sequence. Also
radiation pressure increases with M. So that for a given density rho,
temperature T will be larger, which means that electron-scattering
will be more important. Therefore, in general:

Upper Main Sequence: 
        Large mass stars, 
        supported by radiation pressure
        electron-scattering (energy transport), 
        CNO cycle dominant (energy generation).

Lower Main Sequence: 
        Small mass stars, 
        supported by gas pressure
        Kramers opacity (energy transport), 
        PP chain dominant (energy generation).

The following are some "homologous" relationships for M, R, L, T on
the upper and lower main sequence. These are from Bowers and Deeming
Table 7.3, which follows the Upper and Lower Main Sequence assumptions
above.

Upper Main Sequence: 
R ~ (kappa_0 epsilon_0)^{3/4} * G^{21/164} * M^{37/82}
L ~ kappa_0^{1/2} * epsilon_0^{3/2} *G^{-2} * T^{125/4}
T ~ (kappa_0 epsilon_0)^{-2/111} * G^{5/41} * M^{2/41}
L ~ kappa_0^{-42/41} * epsilon_0^{-1/41} * G^{297/164} * M^{125/82}

Lower Main Sequence: 
R ~ (kappa_0 epsilon_0)^{2/15} * (G mu)^{-1/3} * M^{1/15}
L ~ kappa_0^{-1/6} * epsilon_0^{5/6} *(G mu)^{-4/3} * T^{81/12}
T ~ (kappa_0 epsilon_0)^{-2/15} * (G mu)^{4/3} * M^{12/15}
L ~ kappa_0^{-16/15} * epsilon_0^{1/15} * (G mu)^{23/3} * M^{27/5}

kappa_0 = constant of opacity from Kramer's opacity formula (function
of chemical composition)
epsilon_0 = constant of energy generation rate (appropriate for H
burning)
G = gravitational constant 
mu = mean molecular weight 
M = mass 
T = temperature

Bowers and Deeming have an interesting discussion about these
relationships. First, there is a mass-luminosity relation of L ~ M^5.4
for the upper main sequence and L ~ M^1.6 for the lower main sequence.
These indices (5.4, 1.6) are primarily indices of relative importance
of gas pressure and radiation pressure for support of the star.

One can estimate the position of the main sequence in the HR diagram
with these relationships. In the lower main sequence, L ~ T^7 and in
the upper main sequence, L ~ T^31.

The luminosity of stars on the lower main sequence is very sensitive
to the value of G. This may be interesting to cosmology theorists that
demand that the gravitational constant be different in the past than
what it is now.

Also, a change in chemical composition of a star is felt first through
mu, the mean molecular weight, and increases the temperature T by a
factory mu^{4/3} and L by a factor mu^{23/3}. It therefore moves a
star along a line L ~ T^6 in the HR diagram.

You can read more about these homologous relationships in Bowers and
Deeming (Chapter 7), and Chandrasekhar (Chapter 6).

Actually, the luminosity increases significantly (by ~25% as I recall)
as the star consumes H in its core.  Most lifetimes are generally only
timescales, anyway.

   Well, actually (according to everything I've read) it doesn't, and
that's (probably) part of my problem. Gradually a star increases in
luminosity, surface temperature, and radius during it's time on the main
sequence. The Sun probably started out around 30% dimmer (and will
finish almost twice as bright) as it is now, all while still on the main
sequence.
   And I suspect that's part of the problem I'm having: the zero-age
main sequence luminosity won't be the same as the empirically observed
luminosities, due to aging (as well as different masses aging at
different rates, and the fact that low-mass stars haven't been around
long enough to have any "aged" examples present (the galaxy is too
young)).

[snip otherwise reasonable BotE calculation]

> T_hr = 7,2 * 10^9 a  * (m / m_o) ^2

   The dependance on the mass (m^2, in your example) seems wrong; it
implies that massive stars should live longer than low-mass ones, which
is not the case.

Thanks, Erik, you've saved me much time once again. Of course, you may

that post (including Amara's contribution).
   The sort answer seems to be that I'm looking for more precession than

Thursday, 16 September 1999 08:00:00 UTC+1 - Bastian Hanschitz:
Hi there...!

From what I can see, you are looking for several qualities of HRD
main-sequence stars.
(Hope that's true otherwise this has only been an excercise in typing...:)
An empirical mass/luminosity-relationship in first approximation is:


L / L_o = (m / m_o) ^ a
L     : Luminosity of star
L_o : Luminosity of sun
m    : Mass of star
m_o: Mass of sun

a     :  I've found values for  a  between 3.0 and 3.5 (depends on where you
place your tangent...)

Mass/radius-relationship:

R / R_o = ( m / m_o ) ^ 0.6

R, R_o : Radius star / sun


Time on main sequence:

Since luminosity  L remains constant during the main-sequence-phase T_hr,
the star burns the

energy W = L * T_hr

Hydrogen-fusion produces about 6.13*10^14 J from 1kg H.
If one assumes 70% (average percentage in sun's photoshere) of the star's
mass to be Hydrogen, then that amounts to the energy

W = 6,13*10^14 (J/kg) * 0,07 * m = 0,43*10^14 (J/kg)

So the time on the m-s becomes:

T_hr = 0,43*10^14 (J/kg) * m / L

And that thrown into the mass/luminosity-relation gives


T_hr = 7,2 * 10^9 a  * (m / m_o) ^2
a          : years
m,m_o : Mass star, sun


And finally a table showing some values for stars with the same chemical
composition as the sun:

Spectral type:    O5  |    B0   |    A0   |    F0    |   G0   |    K0   |
M0
m/m_o          :    50   |   18    |   3,2    |   1,8    |   1,1   |    0,8
|    0,5
T_hr/years    :   3e6  |   2e7   |   7e8   |   2e9   |    6e9  |   1e10 |
3e10

e6 : 10^6 (for sake of space...)

The large difference in the age of main-sequence-stars leads to the
conclusion that there are still stars being born...

Hope this helps a bit...

BTW: I have this stuff from two german textbooks on astronomy
(Weigert/Wendker "Astronomy and Astrophysics",
Gondolatsch/Steinacker/Zimmermann "Astronomy") and my notes from Prof.
deBoer, Bonn, Germany.

Good, I'm glad -- that took a while (and admittedly I didn't do a
completely exhaustive job).  I'd recommend you pick up some stellar
structure and evolution texts -- there are quite a few available,
although they're all technical, which is somewhat disappointing, since I
remember after seeing _Cosmos_ I was interested in more, but couldn't
find any laymen's boooks on the subject.  I had to wait until I knew
enough to be able to digest some mathematics and physics before I could
learn anything.  Rather disappointing.

It's funny you mention that, because I had actually intended to point
that out.  I don't know precisely what application you're looking to use
this information for, but if it's for (hard) science fiction writing,
you really don't need that much, especially if you're not going into
details, and just putting together settings.  For instance, you need to
know that Sirius' lifetime is almost certainly too short to support
intelligent life, not necessarily exactly what that lifetime is to n
significant figures.  Or for a game or bare-bones simulation,
first-order approximations should do just fine.

Indeed there isn't.  A log-log graph is not a straight line, so it's not
simply a y = x^a, where a is a constant.  a is also a function of x.

Sources quoted in various postings seem to give values ranging from 2.5

If a *does* vary with mass, we need *that* function. <sigh>

.
  When I used the 3.5 power formula, the results I got were nowhere near
given masses and luminosities of nearby stars.  I did a regression 
analysis using data on about 30 nearby stars given in an astronomy book, 
and got L=( M/Msun)^4.34.  Obviously most of these stars were less 
massive than the sun. I think the formula I gave you earlier, based on 
"The Astronomy and Astrophysics Encyclopedia", published in 1990, and 
presumably having better data, gives
results most closely matching the real universe.
Using the above formulas for initial luminosity, Gillette's LZAMS 
equations can still be used to get the relative increase in luminosity 
over time, but as I said before, they overestimate the luminosity of 
stars more massive than the Sun.

   Which is why I initally liked Fogg's version; here, the exponent does
vary with mass in a simple way (as oppossed to a bunch of patched
together power laws, it's a little easier to calculate). but Fogg's
version is limited to 2 Msolar or less (and it has problems, it seems,
even there).
   So I guess if I want accuracy, I use a patched function. <sigh>

   Although the equations you gave overestimate the Lzams significantly
(after all, they yield L=1 for M=1, which is *not* the case for a
zero-age population). So I've got to (at least) uniformly scale the
luminosities down so that L=0.71 when M=1.

   It started out as simple worldbuilding (thus the title), but what I
was aiming at was trying to classify the habitable zones around various
stars (ecosphere width vs. stellar mass vs. stellar abundance, maximum
and average lifetime in the habitable zone, tidal locking, etc.) and so
I got rather interesed in the details (which is where I usually get
stuck). Order of magnitude is good, but it's not the way I was trained.
   Yes, I'm aware of Martyn Fogg's work on this, as well as the very
good book "Circumstellar Habitable Zones" - I just like doing some of
this one my own. Incidently, for others interested, let me recommend:

http://www.planetarybiology.com/principl.htm <http://www.planetarybiology.com/principl.htm>

While there are better resources off-line, this is a pretty good one for
some of this stuff on-line.

One issue is that while stellar evolution is a well-developed theory and
matches very well with observation, it's pretty hard to get exact
figures for all the variables:  mass, luminosity, radius, temperature,
composition, age, etc.  You can't measure the mass if it's in a binary
(and even then you can only get the total mass of the binary); and all
the rest have a complex nonlinear relationship.

a does indeed vary with mass... it depends on how much of the entire
curve is used in the fitting.  For sunlike stars, it is mildly different
than for much bigger stars or much smaller ones, and for brown dwarfs
the dependence is very nonlinear because you are close to a cutoff.

Many nearby stars are not on the main sequence... it is good to remember
that.

The best thing to do is take a published curve for zero-age or evolved
main sequence... or just the (thicker) observed main sequence, and fit
to that.  What I would do is fit the upper and lower parts of the curve
separately and then use a roll-over for the transition.  Use your
favorite method...  you'll need at least a calculator anyway.

   Agreed, which is why I started with a theoretical relationship for
zero-age main sequence stars. In other words, since I'm trying to get a
statistical estimate, I can just set all the variables to the values I
want, and generate statistics (as to what they *mean*, of course, is a
different problem).

.
L=1 for M=1 at age zero. Obviously the sun is older than age 0, and when
you plug in the LZAM formula, as you said, the luminosity of the sun is
now about 1.4.
Incidentally, you'll also have to adjust for initial composition of the
stellar material.  Martin Schwarzschild, in "Structure and Evolution of 
the Stars" gives
Luminosity is proportional to k^8.06.
 where k= 1/(2X + 3/4 Y + 1/2 Z)
where X= fraction of hydrogen in star by % at age zero,
      Y= fraction of helium in star by % at age zero,
      Z= fraction of heavier elements by% at age zero.
Tha book was published in 1958, so maybe new date have ruined this 
theoretical model.

I agree with your general point, but you stated it a little backwards:  
The mass can be determined ONLY in binary, or multiple star systems.
I read on an astronomy site lately that luminosities  and masses of stars 
within 10 parsecs of us are correct to within about 10% for each factor.

Hardly a little backwards -- I got it _exactly_ backwards.  Give me some
credit for screwing up truly badly!

If it wasn't already fairly obvious even from the context, that was a
flub of the fingers -- we can only measure the mass (the sum of the
component stars', actually) directly in multiple star systems; for stars
in isolation we have no way of measuring its mass.

Indeed.  Astrophysics is a hard science, after all -- it's ultimately
dictated by observation, no matter how elegant the theory is.  If it
disagrees with experiment, then it needs revision; the theories that we
presently have match with observation (what we _can_ observe) to an
acceptable degree.

Brian, I have something that might be useful for you, if you are
interested in order-of-magnitude kinds of things regarding
main-sequence stars. What I offer is based on star-catalog data, so
this is an empirical approach.

In the summer of 1993, I sifted through the Wooley 25 pc and the
Yale Bright Star catalogs, in order to organize and filter out main
sequence stars, which were, based on other criteria, going to be
part of a selection of circumstellar disk stars to observe with ISO,
the Infrared Space Observatory.

I pulled out the 100 brightest stars of each spectral type, and
plotted them on an HR diagram: absolute magnitude versus spectral
type and fit polynomial curves to the diagram to arrive at minimum
and maximum bounds for main sequence stars. (I took +/- 1? sigma for
the bounds plus another 30% from the highest absolute magnitude).
Some stars were mis-classified, and other stars could be one of two
classes, so I frequently had to go to SIMBAD to look up more
information on a star to see where the star probably should belong
on the HR Diagram.

It's rough, but by eye, it seems to give a good envelope of absolute
magnitudes for main sequence stars for each spectral type.

You can see a plot of the result at:

http://www.amara.com/past/HRDiagmed.gif <http://www.amara.com/past/HRDiagmed.gif>

(from the page: http://www.amara.com/past/irexcess.html <http://www.amara.com/past/irexcess.html>)

So the empirical filter to keep the main-sequence stars is the
following, where "stype" is the spectral type, in a numerical format
so that 0 = '0', 1 = 'B', 1.2 = 'B2' etc.


lowest absolute magnitude for main sequence stars = 
-6.3755 + 6.8529*stype - 1.6762*stype^2 + 0.1621*stype^3

highest absolute magnitude for main sequence stars = 
uabsmag= -0.50779 -0.080193*s - 0.21704*s^2 + .0049891*s^3
uabsmag = uabsmag - 0.3*uabsmag  ;subtract additional 30%

Below is some old IDL code, that might be useful.  Have fun.
