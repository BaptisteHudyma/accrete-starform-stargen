The first 4 are source code for random system generation routines and fractal
landscapes.  The 9 universe files are past messages, rec.games.frp/programmer
articles relevant,.....

I also put in Universe10 and Universe11 as well as Actual and the
Shebs thing (what shuld I call it?) but I havn't removed the
mail headers yet or looked at them.

Name:           Universal Simulation Mailing List (usml) ftp site
Address:        topgun.agps.lanl.gov (192.12.184.4)
Notes:          Once upon a time, some net.people made a joke about writing a
                program or two that simulated the Universe. Ho ho ho. Pretty
                funny. But other people took them seriously and thus was born
                the short lived mailing list called usml, and thus were written
                a number of programs which simulated various parts of the
                universe. There are subsector generators for Traveller, star
                system generators using several methods, and plate tectonic
                generators to generate random land masses (not very pretty).

                Here are the contents of pub/usml:

                generators to generate random land masses (not very pretty).

                Here are the contents of pub/usml:

  Actual.  A log containing some information on "Actual".
  OtherSun.src by Sean Malloy. A program to generate a "hex" containing
    about 1000 stars and generate planets for the stars using the Other
    Suns SFRPG rules.  Written in C.
  Psychohistory.  A log containing a long discussion on various newsgroups
    about psychohistory.
  accrete.c and accretion.src, by Matt Burdick.  A program incorporating
    many astrophysical formulae to generate stars and planets by accretion.
    Matt has done a lot of research in journals to come up with the
    relationships; the program is very complete.  Accrete.c is in C
    while accretion.src is the same thing in Turbo Pascal.
  empire.0.9.2:
    The current version of empire from Berkeley.
  fractal.c, by Ed King.  A program to generate rectangular pieces of terrain
    using a fractal algorithm.
  plates.c, A program to implement a set of plate tectonic algorithms by
    Mark Isaak
  references, by Jim Meritt.  Contains about a hundred journal references
    in every branch of science related to simulation of natural
    phenomena.
  shebs, by Stan Shebs.  A 13-page document describing a philosophy for
    simulation of a universe once it is created.
  siod.c, sources to siod (scheme in one defun).  siod is a subset
    of scheme written in C by George Carrette (g...@bu-it.bu.edu <>)
  system.arc, by Andy Sheppard.  A program to generate star systems and
    planets using rules from Future Law / Tech Law and GURPS Space, plus
    a lot of Andy's own research and ideas.  Written in C.
  traveller.src, from comp.sources.games in 1987.  A complete program,
    written in C, that generates a sector using all the rules from Traveller
    Book 6, Scouts.
  xc5.1-tar.Z - Current version of Xconq written by Stan Shebs.

  Volume1:  Contains the archives of conversations up to Sept 22, 1988.
            This is when I standardized my digest format... Also includes
            stuff from moderator before me.
  starform:
    This program is based on an article by Martyn Fogg in the Journal of the
    British Interplanetary Society (JBIS) called 'Extrasolar Planetary Systems:
    a Microcomputer Simulation'.  In it, he described how to generate various
    sun-like solar systems randomly.
