Subject: Hortalez Et Cie, LIC


Hi all;

   HAs anyone noticed the amount that this LIC (Limited liability Imperial
Charter) or more commonly mega-corporation owns. Esp. other mega-corps
such as:

    General Products 26%
    GSbAG            19%
    Instellar Arms   30%
    Ling Standard    26%

These are just a few of the mega-corporations (The above figures quoted from
Mega-Traveller Referee Companion Pg. 40-41). I thought that is was a little
strange, or actually didn't expect the numbers to be so high. I can see a
insurance company investing in alot of different things to get a return on
there rates, but this surprised me. What effect does the Rebellion have on
these mega-corps?? I was under the impression that they would like to
maintain the status quo and a LIC such as Hortalez would eventually come into
play in the rebellion. Or would the company try for profits in the war
area, trying to get as much profits as possible? I am probably just
rambling here, but I would be interested in opinions. Also, since Metlay has
offered the services of a librarian, I have one question. Any information on
the Hortalez family. It must be very important family in the fallen Imperium
regardless. I would be interested in using some of this for an adventure
for the characters in my campaign. When you start talking about espionage
and stuff, this is the kind of things I would love to get my character in
the campaign into hot water with. Anyways, enough ramblings for now....

Greetings!

With all the talk about World Builders programs I figured I may as well
announce mine.  I have started work on a system generation program for
2300AD that integrates the best (IMHO) parts of the WBH into the basic
system generation rules of 2300AD.  If there are any 2300AD people out
there who are interested, let me know at CHOINSKI@ENV.PRIME.COM and I
will see what can be done.  There are two things to note, however:

1) I am doing this on my Amiga.  If you have an amiga, you should enjoy it
   since it uses a graphical interface.  (basically, to generate the
   Sol system takes 6 gadget clicks -- one to get the Primary requester,
   three to select the primary's type, size and sub-number, one to okay
   the primary, and one to hit the "populate" button -- total time of about
   10 seconds.

2) If you DON'T have an amiga, I can give you the core routines that actually
   create the system (no graphic interface) as source code.  The code is in
   Modula-2.

Subject: History!


To Metlay and all amateur historians:

Yes!  Tell the newer Travellers, like myself, what you know of the history
of the game and the Imperium.  Valuable information, now that so much of the
original development is out of print...

And now, a question!

I'm running a MegaT campaign in the Spinward Marches (I know, so is everybody
else), and I would like to give my players some "everybody knows this"
information...  There was some mention a few weeks back about some local
nobility in the Marches, and their relationship to Norris.  Are there any other
noble families that "everybody" in the Marches would have heard about?  (Or any
other celebrities for that matter)

Thanks for any info...

Bob Mahoney

Subject: Hit the deck! INCOMING LIBRARY DATA!



Hi de ho.

Well, with the blessing of Our List Admin who Art in Tektronix, I've become
historian for the List. I shall endeavour to do justice to my claims, having
now put my proverbial foot in it! |->

To work!

To C. Harald: I only do Traveller and MegaTraveller. I consider 2300 to be an
abomination for two reasons: first, it's predicated on Twilight, which is in
turn predicated on the utterly fallacious and dangerously stupid concept of a
limited and survivable nuclear war, and second, it looked like a positively
fascinating future history until they introduced the Kafers and blew it to
hell. Besides, if this List covers 2300 I'm not aware of it. And thanks for
the suggestion; Gerry and I have been GenCon pals for umpteen years now, and
he may well be able to help me. Does he have an Email address, or should I
(gasp) pick up the phone? I owe him a call anyway....

On the Hortalez family: there is virtually no data in the public domain on
these families that I know of. I believe that they've been deliberately set up
but left vague as a basis for future adventure ideas. You should do whatever
you want with them, and keep us posted! Also, there are so many
subcorporations of Hortalez, each larger than anything on Earth these days,
that you can easily "cauterize" your adventure if it turns out later that
you've done something wildly against "prevailing wisdom." I use a lot of
feeder corporations in my games, as industrial espionage is a blast
(literally).

On Manipulation: the Hiver concept of manipulation began thousands of years
ago, when the Hivers were first developing into city-states. The first
Manipulator, known to humans as M. Primus, suggested that a road be built
across a populated peninsula, linking several citystates together. This, he
said, would provide better markets and less food spoilage in transit. The road
was built, and within a few years, use of it had blended the cultures of the
various citystates to the point where it was decided to form a single nation.
Primus, at that point, stood up and revealed a sealed document, years old,
that stated that he had planned for this to happen all along! The people were
shocked and amazed, and overnight the concept of manipulation became a strong
facet of Hiver intellectual pursuit. (What happened to Primus? Well, some say
he was elected president; others say he was lynched. C'est la vie.)
	Since then, the Manipulators' Club on Guaran, and later on Glea, has
listed Manipulations and accorded the status of Manipulator to worthy
applicants. A "legal" Manipulation must fulfill the following criteria:

1. It must be designed on two levels, a superficial level with superficial
effects, and a deeper level with unstated yet definite goals.

2. The parties being manipulated must remain unaware of the manipulation at
all times during the course of the manipulation.

3. The entire manipulation, with a full prediction of superficial and deep
effects and processes, must be filed with the Manipulators' Club before the
manipulation begins, and must not be opened until the applicant tells the Club
to do so, usually as part of a package of evidence demonstrating that the
manipulation has been completed successfully.

As an example, my player, David, has always been fascinated with the Hivers,
and in our first non-Spinward-Marches campaign he jumped at the chance to run
one, but eventually decided to take a human instead for other reasons.
However, the concept of manipulation appealed to him, so he elected to try to
become a Manipulator. He took the film crew of which he was producer, and made
a documentary on the unstable political situation on a world in the Solomani
Rim. Ostensibly, this was to inform the public and encourage sentiment to get
the Imperium to intercede. Of course, the Imperium did no such thing, but the
megacorporation from which he'd been fired years earlier got a copy of the
film, and decided to exploit the situation for their own ends. The problem was
that a Scout team caught them worsening the situation, and the vice president
in charge of the operation (who'd fired this guy at the age of 27) was hauled
before an Imperial High Justice Tribunal. The irony of it all was that to nail
this guy, he exploited the suffering of an entire planet, and if the situation
had taken one more year to mature, the Rebellion would have ruined everything!
The upshot was that the Manipulators' Club on Glea received his package,
looked at it carefully, and now his name is no longer Iscin Delano Jaeger,
it's M. Iscin Delano Jaeger! (He tells everyone the "M" stands for "Mister".)
Sick, huh? I love this stuff! |->

One final note: I'm looking into a membership in the HIWG, the History of the
Imperium Working Group, for myself. This will give me access to history and
development as it's being written, and will enable things not in the usual
literature to be disseminated (with due credit to the HIWG, of course) to the
List. Two questions, though: Is anyone on the List a member, and/or does
anyone know how "Official" the HIWG's work is? I've heard it's considered
gospel, but haven't had this confirmed yet.

Well, that's it for this report, folx. Keep asking them there questions, and
let me leave you with the answer to my first rhetorical question on the list I
gave last time: You'll get laughed at for buying a first printing of HIGH
GUARD because it was wrong practically from cover to cover; the second
printing corrected so many errata that it was literally a brand-new book.

Later,

Subject: Nobility and celebs in the Spinward Marches



Bob:

I'm assuming you're looking for "gospel" famous types, right? I mean, Near Miss
is a lot more famous than most people in the Marches, but GDW hasn't picked up
their option yet, so I'm stuck. |->

Well, let's see. There's Leonard Bolden-Tukera, Marquis of Aramis, a profligate
butthead whose wife is a Tukera heiress and who supports the illegal activities
of Tukera and its interface line Akerut as long as he gets paid off regularly.
There's Marc hault-Oberlindes, Baron of Feri and president of Oberlindes Lines,
a slick little shipping firm that's been burning Akerut out of its business in
the Regina subsector for years and is expanding into the Aramis subsector now.
There's the Leader of Roup, whose primary claim to fame is that when he tells
people to do something, they do it. And there's the Matriarch of Mora, about
whom more in a recent issue of Travellers' Digest.

As for other celebs, there aren't too many. But if I ever get around to putting
my Near Miss stories onto the List, you'll meet a few who might transplant well
to your campaign, some serious and others lighthearted (Her Grace the Duchess
Samantha Vanderkloot, owner of the famous Vanderkloot Diamond and the even more
famous Vanderkloot Cleavage, and her archrival Dame Lucretia Blithering-Snipe).

I'll flip through the lit and see what else I can find. If you're desperate,
you can always throw in (gak) Akidda Laagir and his band of incompetents....|->

Subject: Trojan Reach


I'm working on a pirate/treasure hunt scenario that will take
place in the Trojan Reach.
  For three years now, a friend and I have been running a campaign
wherein all the players were serving members of the Imperial Navy.
They're based on Wonstar in the  Five Sisters sub-sector, and have
been  suppressing  piracy in  District 268,  saving Candory from a
nefarious Zhodani plot and several other things.
  We now want to extend operations into the Trojan Reach, and have
been extrapolating data from the Imperial Atlas  and various other
very skimpy sources.  Now, recently I noticed an ad in an issue of
Travellers Digest  for a  canadian fanzine called  Third Imperium.
The ad states that, among other things, each issue contains a sub-
sector of The Trojan Reach.
  I'm very much interested in getting hold of whatever information
is contained in these issues. Is there anyone who will help me get
it?  Either by mailing me the world data or photocopies of the re-
levant pages? Or, if back-issues are still available, buy them and
send them to me.  I will  of course reimburse  your expenses  (but
check with me electronically first,  I'm not interested in getting
several sets of Third Imperium from different people).  I've had a
friend look for this  fanzine in californian games shops,  but the
ones he has found  stocks  very few  american fanzines,  let alone
canadian. Does anyone know of a good games shop in the LA area?

Hans, the Trojan Reach near the Imperial Border is called the Outrim Void.
I don't know how "official" the Third Imperium stuff is, but the Egyrn and
Pax Rulin subsectors are detailed to great accuracy in GDW's Adventure 4,
LEVIATHAN. I hope that the Third Imp people haven't tried to "update" this
information....

No history archives for two weeks, as I am going to (ugh) Notre Dame to do

enough to actually live in South Bend, I'll be at the Randall Inn; call and

Greetings fellow travellers,


This is the only star system I was sent.  I am not sure if it came
through the mailing list, or if it was sent directly by James Perkins.

Please, I need a few more.  This showed up a small problem which I was
able to fix, but I would like to test it with a few more/

I ran it through the program two times, so you will be able to see
the differences between two different runs.

Check the "Best of the Journal" which reprinted the best articles
from JTAS. Problem is, the Best ofs are now themselves out of
print.

I have a complete collection of JTAS; I'm willing to copy
articles, just let me know your "real mail" address so I
can send it.

By the way, Mike, how do you find time to run a game and be a
grad student at the same time? Between class work and my assistantship,
I hardly have time to breathe. Have you cloned youself? If
so, how can I get one (of myself that is).

Subject: Is it Strephon?  Or is it Memorex?


Good morning, Mr. Phelps.

Traveller's Digest (#11?) relates in one of it's "Rebel Reporter" articles
that Strephon used two look-alikes, a robot, and a clone.  Lucan and Dulinor
maintain that the "Real" Strephon is the robot...

Has HIWG/GDW/DP made any decisions about the actual facts in this case?
(I personally like the idea of a legitimate Emperor stuck out in the cold,
trying to convince people he's himself.)

My player's are heading in this Strephon's direction, and I would like to avoid
making decisions that might be complicated by a later "official" product I
might want to use.  Does anyone have any facts, or even strong opinions about
this?

Thanks much.

Greetings fellow travellers,


A general question:  Is there anybody out there who is NOT using the
shattered Imperium as the basis for their campaign?  A group of us are
thinking about using a different history as a basis, and were wondering
if anybody else is doing it.

	Well, neither DGP nor GDW has make a decision on this. They think it

But in some of the games my friends run, he is the real thing.

Subject: *Real* star system generation program


Ted Kim <tek@penzance.cs.ucla.edu> and I have been discussing the *real*
star system generation program. It generates star systems comparable
to our own (all have 1 star and about 10 planets), and the generation
is based upon current astrophysical knowledge. Since neither Ted nor I
are astrophysics experts, we'd like to know the following:

1) what classifies a star type (eg. sol is a G-type star, what's that mean?)
   Also, what are the other classes of stars and what does that mean for
   the star system (I think it has something to do with star burn rates).

2) Are there any physics/astronomy/astrophysics people out there who
   could tell us what a *real* binary/trinary star system would look
   like ('yes' and 'no' are *not* appropriate answers :-).

3) Ar there any other star system types that are known to exist aside
   from the stardard unary/binary/trinary systems? (Ringworld and Dyson
   sphere systems are man/being-made and can be anything we want them
   to be).

4) what does "Planet's rotation is in a resonant spin lock with the star"
   mean?


Thanks for any help.

I'm a little rusty on my astronomy hobby, but here goes.

Stars are classified by many things.  The most important factors in
stars are mass, composition, and distance from the observer.  From these
everything else can be deduced:

Basic Stellar Factors:

	Mass: Stars vary from 1/100 to 100 times the Sun's mass.  At
	certain cataclysmic times in their lives, stars will lose mass
	(from 10% to 99% of their starting mass).  Sometimes stars will
	scoop up mass from the atmosphere of a nearby companion.  Most
	stars are about 10-20% of the sun's mass.  Stars larger than the
	sun get progressively rarer, mostly due to their short lifetimes.

	Composition: Stars start out with about 75% Hydrogen and 25%
	Helium.  Stars formed from the ashes of earlier stars which have
	Nova'ed may have dust formed from elements Iron and lighter.
	Stars formed from the ashes of Supernovae (like most stars in
	our galaxy today) are further enriched with elements heaver than
	Iron.  Composition is the single most important factor which
	causes stars to age.  As stars age they fuse the Hydrogen nuclei
	into Helium nuclei.  Stars somewhat more massive (>1.4 Solar
	masses) can develop the core pressure to burn the Helium into
	Carbon, Carbon into Neon, Magnesium, and so on up to Iron.  The
	smaller stars (<1.4 Solar masses) run out of fuel, blow off
	their outer layers, and cool into a naked degenerate matter core
	called a white dwarf.  The larger stars run out of fuel, blow
	off their outer layers in a supernova, and press all the
	electrons and nuclei together (in the naked core) called a
	neutron star.  Or maybe a black hole.

	Distance from observer: affect the apparent brightness of the
	star.  Naturally it has no effect on the intrinsic brightness of
	the star.

Resultant factors:

	Core Temperature: A function of mass and composition.  A few
	million degrees Kelvin is necessary to fuse Hydrogen.  Several
	hundreds of millions of degrees are necessary to create Iron.
	Temperature (and Pressure) of that magnitude can only be
	achieved in the most massive stars.  The core temperature and
	pressure is increased by gravitional collapse, and decreased by
	the radiation pressure of the gamma rays generated by fusing
	elements.  As the fusion rates increase, the core expands,
	reducing the temperature and pressure, causing the fusion rate
	to decrease.  This steady state is why stars burn at a steady
	rate.  Very massive stars have stronger gravity-pressure to
	overcome, so they reactions stabilize at vastly higher reaction
	rates.

	Size: The girth of the star is determined most importantly by
	its composition and core temperature.  Most normal composition,
	that is, main sequence stars (type V) are compact, that is,
	about 1-10 million km in size.  Stars made of white-dwarf matter
	are subcompact (Earth size), and neutron stars are microcompact
	-- only a few km (say 15 or so) across.  Red giants, where the
	core temperature is very high and is goading fusion reactions on
	the star's surface, are bloated out to 100 million to 1 billion
	km in size.

	Surface Temperature: A function of mass and size.  Most surface
	temperatures are in the 3000K-45000K range.  Sol burns at about
	5600K.  Redder "colors" are cool, 3000-4000K.  Yellow is
	5000-7000K, White is 8000-15000K, and the hotter stars have a
	distinctly bluish tint.  This is because the photosphere
	(deepest visible layer of the star) radiates like a black body,
	in a continuous bell-curve of luminosity vs. wavelength.  White
	dwarfs tend to be whitish, Red Giants bloated by high core
	temperatures and high-atmosphere hydrogen burning are very cool
	on the surface.

	Luminosity: The intrinsic brightness of the star; it's total
	energy output.  This is a function of the star's size and its
	surface temperature.  White dwarfs are hot and very small, so
	they are dim.  Neutron stars are hotter still and tinier still,
	so they are even dimmer.  Red Giants are cool but very large, so
	they tend to be very bright.  Stars range from 10000 to
	1/10000'th the luminosity of Sol.

Observable information:

	Apparent magnitude: How bright the star looks from your
	backyard.  A combination of luminosity degraded by distance.
	This is a logarithm of the apparent brilliance of the star.  Sol
	is magnitude -26 or so, the Moon, about -16, Sirius A (brightest
	star) is -1.6, Alpha Centauri A, about 1.0, dimmest observable
	with unaided human eye, about 6.0, Sirius B (white dwarf), about
	15.0.

	Absolute magnitude: Magnitude of star if it were brought to a
	fixed distance of 10 parsecs.  I think the Sun would be around
	magnitude 4.0.

	Color Index: The degree of blueness or redness of the star as
	measured by comparing the brightness of the star from two
	photographs, one taken through blue and the other through a red
	filter.

	Spectrum: A spectrograph is used to look at the emission of the
	star at each visible wavelength.  The bell curve of black-body
	radiation is most evident (hotter stars are bluer, colder are
	redder).  On closer examination, dark and bright lines can be
	distinguished.  The dark lines are caused by gases in the star's
	atmosphere absorbing light from the lower layers; the bright
	lines are emissive gases in the star's atmosphere.  The exact
	position of the lines map out the composition of the stars to
	observing scientists.  Hot stars tend to have very understated
	emission/absorption lines, whereas the cooler stars have very
	pronounced absorption lines.

	The spectral class of the star attempted to classify the stars
	from the spectral lines, and originally we had type A through
	type S stars, with type W Wolf-Rayet stars too.  After much
	studying and theorizing, they realized everything was screwed
	up.  They threw out most of the letters as meaningless, and came
	up with the order O B A F G K M, which classifies normal (type
	V) stars in order of decreasing temperature and size.  For finer
	degrees of measurement, a decimal was added.  Hence Sol is 2/10
	of the way from G0 to K0, a G2 star.

Stellar lifecycles:

	Formation: all stars form from clouds of dust and gas.  Areas of
	the clouds will be more dense, and the stronger gravity there
	draws in surrounding gas, etc., until a proto-star system is
	born.  Often the central mass will have other similarly sized
	clumps gathered with it.  This is a multi-star system.  Others
	may not, like the Sol system.  Any tiny planets tend to clump
	together as the star is warming up.  Eventually the star heats
	up really good and blows away most of the dust and gas around
	it.  Often the young star burns off the volatiles from the
	close-in planets, while the outer ones maintain their hydrogen
	and helium envelopes (gas giants).

	Main Sequence Life: About this time it probably emerges from the
	cluster (in the case of galactic clusters) or spiral arm and
	enters the long-term hydrogen-burning steady state "main
	sequence".  The star spends most of its life converting hydrogen
	into helium, at modest core temperatures.  This is the time a
	star is considered "type V".  For Sol, this is around 10 billion
	years.  For more massive stars, much less time (higher core
	temperatures and much greater burning).  Sirius A, a class A
	star, probably will last 200 million years or so.  For less
	massive stars (class M), 40-50 billion years.

	Uh-oh, low on gas: When the star runs low on hydrogen, the core
	will no longer be able to support itself against gravity, and
	will shrink, compressing and heating up.  The hydrogen outside
	the core, what ther is, starts burning like crazy.  The intense
	heat of this causes the star to bloat hugely into a red giant.

	Small Stars: In small stars (1.4 Solar masses or less), the core
	will tend to continue collapsing into a state of degenerate
	matter called a white dwarf.  The remnant core will then blow
	off the outer layers of the star into a "plentary nebula".  The
	inert dwarf, just hot matter with no energy generation, will
	slowly cool over billions of years, going from spectral class B
	or so down to M and below (a black dwarf).

	Large Stars: The core will collapse futher and further until it
	gets hot enough to fuse the plentiful helium ash into carbon.
	The star has a new lease on life, but the intense temperatures
	makes the helium burn very quickly and it lasts only 1/10 to
	1/100 as long as the hydrogen lasted.  When it runs out, the
	story is repeated.  THe core collapses until it is hot enough
	for carbon to fuse.  The star is like an onion, with hydrogen
	burning on the surface, helium below, carbon below that.  This
	can't go on forever.  When the star reaches Iron, it cannot fuse
	any more to gain energy.

	Neutron Star: at this point the core continues collapsing until
	the electrons, protons, and neutrons are crushed into a gigantic
	ball of neutrons 10-30 km across, the rest of the star falling
	in around it.  Suddenly the core stops collapsing, and the
	infalling matter crashes against the core, rebounding with a
	gigantic shock wave which is crushed out before it can leave the
	star.  At this point heavy elements are created by crushing the
	iron and lighter nuclei together.  A massive burst of neutrinos
	is the neutron core's shockwave of its own.  The neutrinos,
	unlike photons, mostly pass through the matter of the star, but
	those that do collide into the star's matter heat it violently
	and the star's outer 95% rends itself away from the core.  This
	is called a Supernova.  The remnant is a neutron star.  If the
	star was very massive, the neutron star will collapse at this
	point into a black hole.

	The Remnant: The supernova remnant is highly enriched in heavy
	elements.  Undoubtedly the gases and dusts will be swept into
	more star formation in a few million or billion years.  Think of
	the gold in the switches in your computer terminal.  Yep, those
	came out of a supernova long before the solar system formed.

I suggest going to a star party and asking to see a couple
binaries/trinaries.  There are many paintings by artists depicting life
on a planet ruled by binary/trinary star systems.  Read "Nightfall"
(don't see the movie) by Larry Niven and ???..  Look for art in
"Cosmos", by Carl Sagan.

Other than multi-star systems and globular and galactic clusters, there
aren't really any other kinds of systems.  Globular clusters are
ancient, one-shot star formations of several million stars, very poor in
heavy elements.  Galactic clusters (and galactic arms) are full of dust,
gas, and radiation.  They are full of young, hot, massive stars that go
"pop" and raise a lot of radiation.

> 4) what does "Planet's rotation is in a resonant spin lock with the star"
>    mean?

Mercury is an example.  It is in an eccentric orbit, and contains uneven
distribution of mass within itself.  It revolves around the Sun in 88
days, and rotates in 59 days.  Note the 3:2 ratio, a ratio of small
integers.  This has happened because of a resonance; when Mercury is
closest to the Sun, the lowest energy state is when the mass
concentrations on Mercury closest to the Sun.  The Moon is a similar
case in it's orbit around earth, only the ratio is 1:1.  This effect is
usally felt only when the objects are fairly close to one another, and
have been orbiting for a long, long time.

1. Trade and Commerce System - Greg Givler

       			   TRADE AND COMMERCE SYSTEM

This is a prototype of the new proposed trade and commerce system. This
has been culled from suggestions from various sources. Most notably
Mark Power and Edwin Wiles, thank you for your input. I hope that
I haven't munged your ideas. :)
I have placed the events in the same order that they are in the
Mega-Traveller Book. I have repeated the unchanged portions to save
GMs from having to look in two places for the information. There
are very few if any changes in the first few steps, I have commented
on some things that I think that need to be considered for change in
the future. The real changes have happened in the Purchasing area.
I have a purchase table and sale table and a goods table format.
Most of the numbers are arbitrary. In other words I made them up.
If you have suggestions send them to me and not the net. I would
like to see this generate some new article for the digest. If I do
not hear anything in the next week, I will give you the next part
of the installments.

Greg

Steps for TRADE AND COMMERCE:
=============================

1. Source World Details
- -----------------------------
Determine sourceworld's Population and Tech Level.


2. Destination World Details
- -------------------------------
The ship captain must select and designate a destination world within
jump range. Determine destination worlds Population, Tech Level, and
travel zone.

3. Shipments
- ----------------
Passengers are determined at Step 4. Cargo and Freight are both
determined beginning at step 5.

4. Passengers
- -------------------
Determine how many passengers are available for the ship.
Roll once on the High column
Once on the Middle column
Once on the Low column



				PASSENGER TABLE

============================================================================
WORLD DIGIT		HIGH		MIDDLE		LOW
============================================================================

	0		---		----		---
	1		---		1D-2		2D-6
	2		1D-1D		1D		2D
	3		2D-2D		2D-1D		2D
	4		2D-1D		2D-1D		3D-1D
	5		2D-1D		3D-2D		3D-1D
	6		3D-2D		3D-2D		3D
	7		3D-2D		3D-1D		3D
	8		3D-1D		3D-1D		4D
	9		3D-1D		3D		5D
	A		3D		4D		6D

DMs: If destination world Population 0-4, DM -3. If destination world
Population 8+, DM +1.

If any crewmember has STEWARD skill, apply it as a +DM on the roll for
High passengers.

If any crewmember has ADMIN skill, apply it as a +DM on the roll for
Middle passengers.

If any crewmember has STREETWISE skill, apply it as a +DM on the roll
for Low passengers.

DM +(sourceworld TL minus destination world TL).

If destination world is RED ZONE, DM -12, and no Middle or Low
Passengers.

If destination world is an AMBER ZONE, DM -6

Passengers may not exceed the passenger capacity of the ship.

This table may be consulted once per week.

INCOME: Credit the ship with:

Cr 10,000 per High passenger,
Cr  8,000 per Middle passenger,
Cr  1,000 per Low passenger.

[One thing that was discussed is the possibility of charging different
prices for different length jumps. This should be considered a
possibility and I will have an optional table in future articles. I think
that a standard X per jump is a bit much and X per trip not enough. I
would like to see a sliding scale, something similar to what toadys
airlines have. Obviously the above table is the simplest, but not the
most realistic. - Greg]

5. FREIGHT AND CARGO
==========================

Freight consists of paid shipments of goods. Cargo is purchased at the
sourceworld and destination world. Determine the available lots from
the table. Roll once in the major column, once in the minor column,
and once in the incedental column. For each lot determine its size by
rolling the lot size.

				AVAILABLE LOTS
			      ==================

POP		__________Available at Sourceworld________________
DIGIT
		MAJOR			MINOR		INCIDENTAL

0		-----			-----		-----
1		1D-4			1D-4		-----
2		1D-2			1D-1		-----
3		1D-1			1D		-----
4		1D			1D+1		-----
5		1D+1			1D+2		-----
6		1D+2			1D+3		1D-3
7		1D+3			1D+4		1D-3
8		1D+4			1D+5		1D-2
9		1D+5			1D+6		1D-2
A		1D+6			1D+7		1D

LOT SIZE:

MAJOR CARGO:   1D+10 MINOR CARGO: 1D+5 [I have included optional lot
sizes on the cargo determination tables below. This chart could be
used or we can get develop a system where each entry on the purchase
table will have its own range of lot size. I think I like the second
method better, but it will mean some sort of modifier list to be
applied probable based on population. I will work on such a table.

MAJOR FREIGHT: 1D+10 MINOR FREIGHT: 1D+5
Lot size is stated in displacement tons. To convert to kiloliters,
multiply by 13.5

DMs: If destination world is Population 0-4, DM -3. If destination
world is Population 8+, DM +1. If any crew member has LIAISON skill,
apply it as a +DM on the roll for minor cargos. DM +(sourceworld TL
minus destination world TL). If destination world is red zone, there
is no freight. If the goods are freight (carried for a fee of Cr1000
per ton) and their identity does not matter, ignore further steps.
The sum of cargo and freight cannot exceed the cargo hold capacity
of the ship.

This table shows the limit of freight and cargo available to a ship
in a period of one week. A crewmember with Broker skill may consult
this table again once (to find last minute cargo but not frieght).

PURCHASING
- ------------
1) Determine number of available cargos. [ Dependent on starport and
   population? I do not have a table for starport and population, if
   someone out there has some suggestions let me know. - Greg]

2) Determine specific cargos.  Involves a certain amount of searching
   on the part of the players.  Referee rolls on appropriate table for
   trade class.


[I have a small (really) sample of what I am working on. I would like as
much input as you can give. Most of the numbers are based on Book 2 old
Traveller base prices, but are actually rather arbitrary.]

[Here is what I have.

This is a suggested table of goods in a new format. This format will allow the
referee to modify and add more detail to the cargos available.
I have started with Mega-Traveller Table 10a, I have an entry for Lot size,
but this could be optional and you can use the table above. As you can see this
table will take some time to establish and I would like input on what you see.
If you feel that this will not work let me know. I think that we have a rough
beginning here and I know that I need more input. - Greg]

Subject: Monopoly (TM) is Patented too


Regarding the (probably unlamented) dead topic of game copyrights,
I have seen a full copy of the PATENT on the monopoly game.  Its claims are
very specific as to how the game operates, but also has some breadth, such
that Parker Bros may be able to extort some vigourish out of similar games
created to promote other cities.  If anyone wants the number of the patent,
and doesn't have a game box handy, I can step down to the operating systems
group and check the copy.  (Jim did a contract automating the patent office
search system, and pulled copies of patents that intrigued him, including
Samuel L. Clemen's patent adjusable belt buckle; or was it a garter?)

Subject: re: What besides shattered imperium?


Our group and one on the west coast have been using for 10 years now a
campaign in the TL 9 to 12 range set in a non-standard post-imperial-fall
future history.  Paul Gazis (PhD Astrophysics, MIT, now with Voyager at JPL)
created both the campaign setting -- modeled after the long-boat raiding
in dark-age europe -- and the Traveller rules variants in use in both
campaigns.  The east coast campaign is set in a barbarous back-water, the
Scarp region, of the parent-campaign; the two GMs coordinate historical
fluxes between the campaigns, such that a couple of wars from the other
campaign are about to redirect our commercial/exploration campaign.
    Paul's rules modifications consisted of:
* Skill learning system, not unlike that presented in Cosmos by J.Redden,`
   which Paul credits to Mike Yoder and the Eastern Isles campaign of
   Warren Dew, Frank Adams, &co at MIT & DC etc.  (A very low-tech medieval
   game with several games-masters for different islands, which now runs
   in multiple cities on the east coast.)
* Character generation tables for different sub-services and countries,
   not unlike Mercenary/HighGuard but moreso and completed (to all classes)
   sooner.
* Ship construction, maintenance, operation, and combat which didn't offend
   an astrophysicist, but are usable by non-technical players.
* stars live in 3-space, based rougly on the known structure of our galactic
  arm (the Scarp is just this side of the Orion nebula; major, old imperial
  space stations are located on the arm's fringes nearest tangencies to earth)
  Space combat, however, is done either as chalk-board vectors or kriegspieled
  verbally.

His rules variants have been serially published in The Wild Hunt, a role-
playing APA (Amateur Press Association) run by Mark Swanson.  I can provide
information to anyone who'd like more...

From: (Gerry Williams) gsw@moss.att.COM


I once ran a campaign for a short time based on post-holocaust Earth (this
was before the advent of Twilight 2000/Traveller 2300).  It was totally
different from any other Traveller game that I have played.  I based it on
the premise that the Third World War was truly devasting and led to wild
mutations, etc.  That way I could throw in some curves (monsters).  I even
took some Gamma World monsters and converted them into Traveller form (it
was actually very simple to do).

Here's how the campaign went:

The character (in my case there was only one player) started out in post-
holocaust Earth fighting to survive.  He had quite a few skills and great
physical attributes, but no technical training (imagine a barbarian, only
tougher and smarter).  This was, of course, due to the daily rigors of
survival in a post-holocaust Earth.

After a bit of time spent just trying to survive and rebuilding some of
Earth's cities, the character came upon a crashed spaceship.  Exploring
the ship was somewhat hazardous and didn't reveal much anyway, but
eventually the owners of the ship came looking for it.  They had known
about the war on Earth, but were "too late" to stop it, and didn't know
that life was returning to the planet, or, in fact, that anyone was still
alive.  This is what the character was told, at least.  What actually
happened was that the alien race had seen the impending menace of humanity
and used their guile to cause a nuclear conflict on the Earth.  They were
quite upset at the fact that humanity had managed to start rebuilding so
soon (the character had played a big role in this earlier).

Rather than tipping their hands, the aliens pretended to be "friends" and
offered to help rebuild what was left of humanity.  We never finished the
campaign, but it was left off with the human leaders willing to accept
the aliens' aid without question, but the character was already starting
to get suspicious about certain discrepancies in the aliens' stories.  The
aliens also used slave labor from conquered races, and the character would
eventually have discovered this, since he was learning to use the alien
technology alot faster than he let on.  One interesting twist is that the
aliens had used the war as an excuse to grab tens of thousands of humans,
which they had bred and used as slave labor.  By this point there were
millions of humans being used as slaves throughout the nearby stars.

I made a great effort to use real nearby stars when devising this campaign
in order to add a more realistic feel (the Near Star List would have been
a great help at that time).  With any luck, the character would have
discovered a rebellion ready to happen among many slaves, and maybe even
saved a few humans along the way.  Actually, the character would be more
likely crossed by human slaves than by other aliens -- humans are less
reliable than most races.

It was an interesting campaign -- too bad we both left for college and
never got to finish it.

By the way, this was a long time ago, so I don't remember any of the
details, although I probably still have my campaign notes somewhere...

P.S.  If you were looking for a history where, for instance, the Third
Imperium survived, then simply use the old Traveller setting.  Many
campaigns developed in that setting (including some I've been in).  I'm
sure that many people who had already developed elaborate campaigns
didn't want to screw them up by introducing the Shattered Imperium.  A
common one I have seen is the Solomani Revolt, where Earth decides
enough is enough and kicks some Imperial ass.  I personally liked the
idea of a conquered Earth.  In my campaigns in the Third Imperium, the
people of Earth were actually happier under Third Imperium rule, since
they had been tired of fighting and didn't really care who ran the
government anyway.  (Of course there were some who would have preferred
home rule anyway. 8-)

Subject: Request for Traveller Tech


Hi there in Traveller Land...

	I used to play Traveller a while back, and I've finally gotten
into another campaign.  I'm about to start a character who is very
techie oriented and will hopefully come up with a lot of odd, off the
wall devices.  He's starting on a world with TL12, maybe up to 13 or 14
on the black market, and no laws.  He'll have about 4-5 five weeks
before the other players (in transit) arrive, so I'm going to get some
stuff together.

	I want to ask for advice and recommendations from the list,
because I'm not completely familiar with the rules (this is old
Traveller) nor with all of the expansions/alternates.  I'm interested in
advice or suggestions on the gadgets I'm going to make, suggestions on
more gadgets to make, and information on stuff that's already out there
in rules form but I haven't run into it yet.

	One thing I'd like is an idea of what kind of stuff is
available, mainly at TL12, with some stuff edging up into TL13.  The
rules I have aren't too detailed, and I definitely remember things
like holocameras, etc, which aren't detailed in my rules.

Hand Computers

	In this game the HandComputers are very nice, from an article
in a Traveller Digest the GM has.  I very much reccommend this article
(I only wish we had the stuff it talks about in there now!) in which
it outlines some of the things hand computer can do, and some of the
services available to hand computers via packet radio transmissions
(including e-mail, possibility of hacking into the system to track
down somebody by their handcomp, various information services
available, etc).

	One thing it doesn't do much about is software available for
hand computers, and how they can be used, but I guess that can be figured
out as needed, although if there are any such articles I'd appreciate
hearing about them.

Implant Chip

	I remember seeing something called an Implant chip, or something
similar, in an issue of the TASJ, which enabled a character to hook up
directly to the computers.  I'm going to try to get one for my
character, and then use it to interface with my handcomputer and use it
more efficiently.

Eyephone shades

	If I can't get one of those, I'm going to put together a set of
eyephones built into a pair of goggles or shades - eyephones exist
today, and are a pair of LCD screens which fit over your eyes and give
you a color 3D view of a virtual world - different people are developing
them for different reasons, I suppose, but I heard the most about them
in relation to something Autodesk (I think) is coming out with, a
virtual reality system using eyephones and a dataglove as the
input/output device.

	These eyephones will be built into a set of wraparound
sunglasses, and will have input from the handcomputer to the screens,
or from a tiny set of cameras, thus rendering them effectively
"transparent" to me so I can see out.  Minor options include a
rear-view option, and perhaps image processing.  The main reason for
the eyephones is to be able to display information from my
handcomputer for me.

	Then I can feed information in either through a set of
contacts to monitor my brainwaves (far-fetched, but perhaps possible
in TL12, what do I know?) or more realistically, through an
"eye-cursor" a system which tracks whichever spot I'm looking at, puts
a cursor there on the screen, then I can hit enter by blinking in a
special way, etc.  This enables me to do stuff without appearing to,
and to access my Handcomputer without overtly doing anything.

Getting into the Rat Race...

	A series of rodent-sized robots.  They would be equipped with
certain capabilities, the range increasing with the TL and the
development. At first they'd basically be little programmable rodents
that go around and record stuff and carry out orders (through their
computer, or from a comlink) and can self-destruct with a demolitions
charge to destroy the evidence or a target.

	As I get better, I'd add things like an electronic lockpick, a
tiny laser cutter to let them make their own mouse-holes, the ability
to tap into a ships computer and dump schematics so they can find
their way around, perhaps even the ability to dump a virus into the
ships computer so they are ignored by sensors.  Of course, the higher
the TL, the smarter the programming.

	Any suggestions?  Feedback?  Ideas for more whacked out gadgets?
Let me hear from you!

Well, in our 2300AD campaign, we have some tech stuff which is quite useful
to us:

Subderma-Talk

	These are small, multichannel communicators implanted in the
	body. The main radio unit is located somewhere in the left shoulder,
	with the antenna running down the back. The radio is connected to a
	throat implant mike and an implanted ear-piece. It draw power from
	the contraction and dilation of the blood vessels in the shoulder,
	and from shoulder movement. You turn the transmitter/receiver on/off
	and select channels using unusual jaw movements.

	Range is quite short and power is low (easy to jam), but the throat
	mike is capable of detecting minute vibrations and amplifying them
	so that you can 'whisper without any sound' and still be picked up.
	For this reason, the system has been named Telepathy; you can read
	other PC's minds!

Subderma-Comp

	This is a computer (processor and static memory) implanted in the
	back of the neck. It has the same capabilities of a standard
	portable computer. It 'displays' information by interfacing directly
	with either the optic nerve or the visual processing centers of the
	brain (I'm not sure which); the effect is similar to a heads-up
	display. You communicate with the computer by typing on an imaginary
	keyboard (there is a pressure switch to disable this...). There is
	also a jack located on the surface of the skin which allows direct
	connection to a portacomp for software transfers and easier use.

	Having a powerful computer always available to you (even when
	stripped of all equiptment) is useful...

Subderma-Modem

	Naturally, we quickly came up with a way to link the computers to
	the radios so that we can communicate large amounts of data between
	implanted computers and otherwise interface with the outside world
	in situations where using the implanted jack is impossible.


An alien race in 2300AD grows various useful devices. One that all PCs wear
constantly is bio-contacts. These are like ordinary contact lenses (they
will correct your vision if necessary). However, by using various different
squint commands, you can get up to 5X magnification, light intensification,
infra-red sight, etc. Also built in are brightness dampers; you never need
sunglasses and they are fast enough to react to most sudden flashes (e.g.
explosions, lasers in the eye, etc).

Two of our PC's, the robotics expert and the explosives expert got together
and built a bunch of these. They are (of course) programmable with commands
sent from the subdermacomps via subdermatalk. They can transmit low-res
pictures, move around, and can carry small explosives packs. They can also
be programmed to act autonomously (i.e. drive to this location, record for 5
minutes, then destruct). They are incredibly useful; the GM is regetting the
day he let us design them.


Other useful low tech stuff:

	Ceramic knives (hold a *very* sharp edge almost forever, and don't
	show up in airport/spaceport detectors),

	portable neutrino detectors (great for locating fusion power
	sources, e.g. space planes, reactors, grav-sleds, etc).

	'God Gambit' transmitters: a radio that is powerful enough to rattle
	garbage can lids, fillings, and building supports across one face of
	a planet. Useful for getting low tech worlds to think that you are
	omnipotent...

Also see James Bond movies for lots of neat gadgets, and any cyberpunk
novels you can get your hands on.

>Eyephone shades with eye-cursor
	Things that eyephone shades can be used for are weapons tracking,
perhaps tied with a gyro stabelized weapons platform or gun.  How about
that as a guard dog substitute. look at your target, bink to lock the
pointer and say zap.  Robie then unloads a few hundered rounds at the
unfortunate target.
	If you do any combat you can use the shades to provide 360 degree
vision, or view other sensing spectra given your hand comp has the required
sencing equipment.  Perhaps a tricorder style of analysis and comentary fed
into your vision as you view things.
	More mundane and near future uses for such a system would provide
long distance telecomunication, remote monitoring of your situation,
provide a location service (ie maps), remote storage and retrieval of data,
providing access to a computerized expert on a range of topics.
Artificially inteligent expert systems are available now, but these should
be tightly controled by the GM.  Available topics should be very narrow,
commonly available topics, expert systems do not have the intuitive
abilities that humans have.  Current expert systems do things like diagnose
viral diseases, but it would be lost if you had a broken leg.
	Then there is always the terminator solution.  Eyephones display
realtime commentary about surroundings and were used to generate replies
that allowed the terminator to fit in with his current sittuation and
providing him a variety of options.  Swap your hand comp rom pack out and
put in a module for local street slang.  Then when the local street scum
question whether you belong on their turf, you can respond to them
eloquently with out resorting to violence.  I'm sure you could come up with
other ideas given some thought.


>Getting into the Rat Race...
	Swiss army rodents, a new style of computer peripheral hardware.
For breaking into computers I think you would have a better method by using
remote telecomunications from your hand comp.  And a human is a better lock
pick than a machine, but as a bug or spy device it may work.

	Interesting.  I'm working on a pair of smart pistols (sort of back
burner for the moment, while the "fun" stuff gets done) and I think I could
tie the targeting into the eyephones.

> 360 degree vision, or view other sensing spectra given your hand comp

	Interesting, but may take some convincing to get the GM to goforit.

	Many interesting ideas,thanks much... the terminator option,
idaknow.  If I can find a book on streetslang, perhaps, but that won't
be easy.  Maybe drop by a local linguistics dept. at a nearby college...

	Nonono... I think you missed the point.  They aren't designed to
be lockpicks or computer crackers.  Those options are there to increase
the range of possibilities for the Ratbots once they get inside a ship
or building.  Also, most ships have a self-contained system that is hard
to hack into from the outside.  On the other hand, a Ratbot sneaking
into a secure terminal at the heart of the ship and downloading a virus
program...  Your last comment, as a bug or spy device, is precisely on
target.  They are for spying and doing mischief (what the tiny little
hands are for :-)

	This might be fun.  I'm thinking along the lines of programming
an image converter (from one of the journals) into my hand computer,
then filtering the data through the eyephone cameras through the
computer before displaying it to me.

	The other ideas outlined are also interesting, but I think the

	Hmmm... I think you missed the point here.  The reason for the
rats to have the electronic lock picks and computer software is for
THEIR advantage when they're doing stuff, not so I can pull out a rat
and try to lockpick something.  My character's computer and electronics
skills are very high - I could probably hack most anything or pick any
electronic lock.

	As far as remote telecomm, for the most part I agree with you.
Too bad the GM doesn't.  I can see some of his view - that the ships
computers are self-contained and you have to gain entry to the ship to
hack them.  But then again many of the players and NPCs use their hand
computers linked to their ships computers while they're in port.  The
idea behind the ratbot's interface and software is that they can sneak
in to a "secure terminal" and dump the software directly into the
computer, without having to hack past any login software or what-have-
you.

	Speaking of which, what kinds of things could I do with my high
computer skill?  I'm in dire need of some ready cash (all of my benefits
were used getting a +4 intelligence, my hand computer, and a scientist's
scout/courier [from _More_Clout_For_Scouts_ in an early issue of the
Dragon]) and I'm thinking about software as a possible source.  I could
write some "standard" software and sell it, or I could try to do a
better version of the stuff on the list of ships software, or I could
try to write new and unusual programs.  Anybody have any ideas on new
programs for the ships computers, or for hand computers?

	Nice stuff, but out of the question - in this campaign there is
a massive prejudice against cybernetics or bionics - the "shoot on
sight" kind of prejudice.  Comes from having a thirty year war against
cyborgs, I suppose.  I know there is a gadget called an Implant chip or
something similar in one of the Journals of the Traveller's Aid Society,
which does much of what the above do, but I'm hoping it's subtle enough
to pass, perhaps a bio-chip which doesn't show up on a medscan.  Anybody
care to type in the stats and e-mail 'em?  Would be much appreciated...

	Fun gadgets, how about ordering me a few? :-)  Nice, but
probably hard to find.  So far,  the highest TL we've reached (going to
reach) is 12.  There are several TL15 or 16 worlds out there, very
neutral and self-absorbed - and powerful enough to keep it that way.
I'm going to make a sojourn to one of them ASAP.

	Glad to hear this, as it means I'm on the right track.  The only
question is what kind of capabilities it'll have.  The system I used to
generate my character didn't mention any "robotics" skill, and I ended
up with an Electronics-4 and Mech-2.  My computer skill is more than
enough to program them (level 6).  In response to my initial query "I
want to build some little rat robots-" the GM answered "You need
robotics skill."  to which I replied "There isn't any."  To which he
replied "It's in Citizens of the Imperium."  Fun, eh?  Well, he says I
can't design the robots without robotic skill.

[I liked the open-endedness of Traveller skills, but one thing I've
 always disliked about them is the fact that many skills only show up in
 later books, and that there is no easy way to work them into the
 character generation tables in earlier books.  Personally I preferred
 just using general skills instead of breaking things down like that.]

	So I've got a computer full of technical data, I'm going to look
up the designs for various robots, find one that is close enough to suit
my purposes, and then either downscale it to largish rat size (5-6") or
use the originals if it's already in that range (pipe cleaner bots, for
example.)

	Thanks for the suggestions - how about the more common
technology that is around and ready to be perverte to my nefarious ends?

Yes, please.  I would like more info on the ship rules (construction, combat,

otherwise interesting rules, how about letting us know at least what they are
concerned with so people can decide if they want to see them.  I'd be
interested in seeing anything to do with ships and combat, or neat gadgets.

in to a "secure terminal" and dump the software directly into the
computer, without having to hack past any login software or what-have-
you.

	Speaking of which, what kinds of things could I do with my high
computer skill?  I'm in dire need of some ready cash (all of my benefits
were used getting a +4 intelligence, my hand computer, and a scientist's
scout/courier [from _More_Clout_For_Scouts_ in an early issue of the
Dragon]) and I'm thinking about software as a possible source.  I could
write some "standard" software and sell it, or I could try to do a
better version of the stuff on the list of ships software, or I could
try to write new and unusual programs.  Anybody have any ideas on new
programs for the ships computers, or for hand computers?

Well, on one occasion when we were facing an enemy battleship, one character
with a good computer skill and a good computer hacked into the enemy ship's
computer, and caused the ship to jump. No-one ever saw that ship again, partly
because it had been in near orbit round a planet when it jumped.

Electronics, some form of mechanical engineering, and computer programming
skills practically *define* robotics; you should almost get free robotics
skill points for this, or at least be allowed to use these related skills at
penalty.

This is a general comment by the way; Skills are not as narrowly focused in
reality as is implied in RPG skill sets. Many 'skills' are inter-related,
and can be applied to other things. I like hierarchical skill sets much
better than flat ones because of this. i.e. a character with:

        Driving-2 -> GroundVehicle-4

Means that the character has a skill level of 4 when driving wheeled ground
vehicles (cars, small trucks) but has a skill of 2 in *all* other 'driving'
related skills, i.e. small boats, small hovercraft, large trucks, etc.

Of course, the problem is that coming up with a consistent set of
hierarchical skill is, um, difficult (to say the least).

Ammonia and Iodine mixed together makes a great contact explosive. Be
careful though; it is highly volatile once it has 'gelled', which takes
about 20 minutes. Don't breathe on it.

	You're right, you can't visualize it.  For one thing, in the campaign
supposedly *everyone* has handcomputers.  Kinda like a watch, or driver's
liscence.  For another, the input wouldn't be that slow, nor the output,..

	Sounds fun, especially since my computer skill should be high enough
to make that a breeze.  However, our GM has already ruled that ships computers
are generally not acessible from outside the ship.  Does anybody have any
suggestions, or know of any traveller sources that say otherwise?

	So far I've done a few nasty things by sneaking inside the ship to
get access to the computer (with forged documents saying we were from the
starport maintenace service...)

Subject: Oh, damn, he's back!



Yeah, it's me again. Two weeks in that living hell that humans call Notre
Dame, Indiana, doing the impossible for the ungrateful. Pfui!

Anyway, on various topics:

The only thing I'd heard from the DGP staff on the real Strephon was that they
were kicking around the idea of an adventure module with three possible
endings: one, that it's a clone or an impostor, two, that it's a Krenstein
special (i.e. a robot), and three, that it's really Streffie. Anyway, the
module would also contain a mail-in card that would let the ref vote for the
ending he or she liked best, and the "official" history would follow the vote.
(This was mentioned at the DGP roundtable at GenCon 1988, and no word since.)

On non-Imperium Traveller: I've done it twice, both times to introduce new
players to the game's mechanics. The universes were unremarkable future-
histories on a limited scale, but they went over well. The players were very
young, and found the Imperium a bit overwhelming.

On new and bizarre gear: There's enough material in my files for a separate
article on the subject, so that'll come along later. My specialty is in hand
weapons development, but other gizmos have made themselves known....

And to Jim Cunningham: The secret is in prioritization over time. I do what's
important to me at any given moment. Since I'm between finishing up my classes
(May 1987) and finishing up my thesis (sometime in 1990), I have more
flexibility for my writing, gaming, and music. Hopefully, in 1990 I'll be able
to get my Traveller book published, release my second album, finish my thesis,
and get married and honeymoon in New Zealand for a couple of weeks, all
without the need to resort to cloning or other drastic measures. I had to
shoot my clone two years ago, when he finished taking my comprehensive Ph.D.
exams for me and demanded time with my girlfriend as compensation.

(Realistically, though, I'll settle for the wedding and the Ph.D. |-> )

There are two ways to tackle this, depending on whether or not you think
the Navy (or Army, or whatever your character is from) uses robots. If it
does, then you could substitute Robotics for Electronics, the nearest
available equivalent. If it doesn't, tough - your character never met a
robot, and wouldn't know what to do with one. You might substitute it for
Computer skill instead.

Mind you, I'd think that actually building the thing, as opposed to using
or programming it, would use Electronics anyway. After all, the world's
best computer programmer (Computer-10?) couldn't design and build even a
simple microcomputer, unless he had some Electronics skill.

So where no specific skill is available, use the nearest one to it. If
necessary, have a word with the referee during character creation, and
substitute the new skill for an old, similar one.

It claims to be MS-DOS compatible (insert favourite insult here:-). What
that means on a machine with no disc-drive isn't quite clear; I believe you
can copy any MS-DOS software to it via its comms. link, then run it.

Subject: Stellar information


[I admitted to being somewhat rusty on my astronomy hobby.  Now everyone
listen up for these corrections/additions/clarifications.
- --jamesp@dadla.wr.tek.com]

Recently, there was a posting regarding stellar information for someone
who wanted "real" star system generation information.  Some of the material
in there was not quite correct and some was wrong.  I will attempt to clear
up a few things.

First, stellar classification is done by 1) mass, 2) temperature, 3) (much
less important) composition.  The third point is usualy equivalent to
age, but not always.  All stars go through several evolutionary stages
which are more or less the way they were described in the previous posting.

Mercury is *not* tide locked.  It was believed to be tide locked into the
sixties, and some *current* text books still list it as tide locked, although
it most certainly is not.  This is certainly an easy mistake to make given
the state of astronomical literature, but it is a mistake, none the less.

Stars in globular clusters.  Don't worry about it in a Traveller universe.
It is possible that a planetary system could develop and could remain
relatively stable within a globular cluster for billions of years.  It is
also very possible that the system would be torn to shreds by a star passing
nearby, it depends on the circumstances.  You don't need to worry about
systems in globulars because 1) they're very old, which means they're *very*
metal poor.  Therefore, not only is civilization unlikely to develop there,
but nobody except scientists would want to go there (personally, I'd give
up several limbs to get a close look at one.), 2) They are so far away
(on the order of 50,000 light years) so that without a massive advance in
primary drive technology, nobody will get there.

Binary stars can be contact binaries (literally touching each other) to
very distant binaries (on the order of a couple of light years).  They
can also be anything in between.  If the stars are close enough, distant
planets can pretty much treat them as a single star (see variable stars
below, though).  If they are distant enough, a planet can treat them as
two separate stars; orbit one and ignore the other.  If the system is
one main star with a companion orbiting in a planet-like orbit (distance
wise) foget it.  Not only are no stable orbits possible, (assuming
both stars are massive enough to be significant) but humans and human-like
life couldn't survive the radical climatic changes.  Other life forms,
however, might be able to.  The instability of the orbits is a *real*
problem, though.

Other system types?  How about a planet orbiting a variable star.  All
close (contact) binaries will be variable.  Unless you are very high
tech, or very adaptable, or really weird, you (as a species) will not
be able to survive in a variable star system like an RR Lyrae, delta
Cepei, W Virginis, omicron Ceti, U Geminorum or other "well known"
variable star type.  Good for curiosities and weird adventures, though.
Flare stars and X-ray binaries pose a special hazard to travellers.
All of these stars in the shattered imperium will be well known and
*very* well studied.  I would also guess that with the possible exception
of Semi-regular red giants and ZZ Ceti type stars, their periods will
be very well known, especially by Travellers.

I hope this helps.  If there are any questions, let me know.

Hi out there in Mailing List Land...

	I've got a question:  The original traveller game doesn't
give much of a solid idea of what you can do with computer skill,
even though it has more information than most other skill descriptions.
This is because the traveller books don't give that much detail about
computers in the traveller universe.

	From what I've read here,  the new traveller games have much
more detailed "task" systems.  What do they have on the Computer skill,
and on computers in the traveller universe?

Subject: Computer Skills
Date: Wed Sep 27 21:44:59 1989
From: richard@agora.hf.intel.COM (Richard Johnson)



I would like to offer a tangential thought about computer skills.
In my campaigns, especially the more recent ones, computer skills are
tied not only to the model of computer (such as mod 1 bis, etc.), but
are also tied to the tech level of computer on which the skill is
gained, and other general infomration about the character.

Skills are not to useful (such as at -2, -3, 1/2 or whatever I feel
appropriate at the time {keep the GM in fresh coffee :) }) when used
with unfamiliar technology, with unfamilar software, or with unfamiliar
systems. This is true for both forward and backward technology
incompatibility.


For example:

Hypothetical player Steve is running even more hypothetical ship's
engineer I. M. Smart (697DC7).  Smart has computer -3.  He acquired
the skill as an engineering officer on an Imperial destroyer
(most of our Imperial machinery is TL 14 or so) using a special-
purpose Model 5 engineering computer.

Now Smart has bluffed his way into an engineering job on a TL 11
subsidised merchant (about 400 Tonnes...) and is constantly frust-
rated with the antique operating system, the clumsy interface, and
the lack of speed of the ship's sole computer -- a Model 2 Bis.

Anyway, you get the idea.

When enterprising parties discover "Ancients" or alien technology -
well, you can imagine the consternation of trying out something
totally from scratch.  Why should computer behave in any way like
what we expect ours to?


Summary:

I guess what I'm saying is "keep people challenged, but don't
destroy them."  I'm just a little negative about computer skill
in general, because I believe at the tech levels we're simulating,
they'll all be neurally connected to our brains anyway.

Hey, gang, I haven't forgotten my promise to submit a feature on Traveller
gear, but I'm going to have to alter it a bit to remove some references to
gear that I'll be attempting to publish in the Travellers' Digest and in
Challenge. If it gets in, then it'll be official and you can read about it
yourselves, and if it doesn't, well, then I'll publish it here as a variant.

Anyway, one question: does anyone know what MegaTraveller policy is concerning
the HFMP-15? This was the "Hand Flamer," a low-efficiency plasma pistol for
use with battle dress, as introduced in JTAS (Issue #3, I think). The idea was
to have a relatively low-powered sidearm for use in cramped situations,
powered from the same fusion pack that powered the battle dress. It seemed
like a good idea, and is certainly plausible in technological terms (plasma
devices on its scale exist today, for use in welding heat-resistant metals and
so on), but it never seemed to catch on. Most of the weapons that were
introduced in the JTAS, like the autoshotgun, tranq rounds, and the ARL, have
been incorporated into the official rules, but there's no mention of the
HFMP-15. Pity, too; it was a nifty little gun. Did they leave it out to try to
conserve game balance? That seems silly since it's not concealable unless you
remove the fusion pack |-> .

And by the way, what exactly are those fusion packs, anyway? Are they really
small fusion reactors? If so, then how are the "minimum reactor size per Tech
Level" figures reconciled with them?

Just curious....

The big question in getting up my archive server was "how are people going
to find the articles they want?"  If you know the number of the article
you want, it's easy, just ask for it, "send traveller tm534", also if you
know the author or subject, you can look for it in the index, which you
can get with "index traveller".

Are there other indexes or references that you want in order to find the
articles you want?  If so, please tell me about them, so I can look into
adding them.  Thanks.

Forget all your smart handguns, forget eye-piece gunsights! I've got the
ultimate weapon. :-)

It depends on fibre-optic cable capable of carrying a laser pulse of
laser-rifle power.

In your backpack, you have the power unit and the laser itself. The laser
should be switchable between either of two power settings.  The low power
setting produces a continuous low power beam, about the same power as a small
targetting laser. The high power setting produces a pulse similar to the one
from a laser rifle (or for a lighter backpack, a laser carbine).

In your hand, you have a small pistol. It has a two-stage trigger. It is
connected to the backpack by a cable containing a fibre-optic line and an
electronic control line. When you pull the trigger to its first stage, the
laser is triggered on its low power, continuous mode, and you have a
targetting laser which you can wave around and point at things. When it's
pointing at something interesting, like the bad guy's head, you pull the
trigger the rest of the way. This switches the laser to its full power pulse
mode, and a laser rifle bolt goes right where your targetting beam was just
a moment ago.

If you can't have a dual power laser, have two lasers linked to the same
fibre-optic cable; one low power, the other straight from an ordinary rifle.
This method is probably better in that the targetting laser can be IR, so
you aren't lighting yourself up at the same time. You, of course, are wearing
goggles which allow you to see where the target beam is hitting.

Assuming it works, how do you implement this in a game? What die roll do you
need to hit, assuming you can take an aimed shot? The way I see it, it seems
to be impossible to miss.

	Yuh, I understand... several game systems seem to be working towards
this, GURPS with their default skills, the new Shadowrun with their skill
web (you start at one node of the web which represents a skill; each node
further away is a modifier to attempt that related skill.  Interesting idea.)
Traveller (old traveller, at least) seemed to be trying a simpler method to
attain this - simply broadly defined skills instead of hyperspecialization.
This would also make sense for "adventurer" types, since if they were hyper
specialized they'd have some great job with a corporation and stay at home.

	Unfortunately, all of that changed as new books were introduced with
more skills.  It wouldn't be half so infuriating if the new books "back-dated"
the old books, so that all characters could get all skills.

	One other problem with old traveller was lack of task definition. From
what I've seen here, the new traveller rules have very specific task definition
perhaps TOO specific :-)

It's probably very accurate but comparatively slow.  It'd be great
sniper/assassin weapon, but I'd be inclined to severely restrict its
snap shot potential and/or give the other side a chance to notice that
someone is painting cute little red spots on them.

Subject: A system for generating new TRAVELLER weapons (*LONG!*)



Hi gang! This one's for gearheads only, and it's kind of long, so bear with
me, okay? You can always delete it if you get bored! |->

On the subject of fun gear for tech-heads, the various Traveller games I've
run over the years have had more than their share of bizarre gadgets and odd
weapons. It's become a tradition for players to fill out their characters and
give them depth, not only by developing philosophies, religions, personal
habits and beliefs, and so on, but also by designing and building or having
built special items for combat and technical use. These included various odd
technical gizmos, customized weapons, and a class of items that became ongoing
traditions in my campaigns and which may get added to the official rules if I
can get anyone at GDW or DGP to listen to me, so they'll have to wait a while.

It's amazing to see and hear the detail to which people will go to create
weird and dangerous items to give them an edge over their foes. One of the
most popular tricks I used was to allow characters weapons and gear that were
customized to the point of ridiculousness, based on the following set of
restrictions:

1. Money, construction skill, and tech level and law level of the world and
factory or weaponsmith's shop where the device was built would all control and
limit the capabilities of the final device.

2. In the case of weapons, the weapon design would be somewhat similar to an
existing weapon in the rules lists, with certain differences suggested by the
player and allowed by the ref. The weapon would either be:

	a. Essentially identical to an existing weapon in terms of rules (i.e.
	   the same range limitations, effectiveness against armor, etc.), but
	   somehow unique in its operation (thus lending "flavor" to campaigns
	   where it was used), and/or

	b. A modification of an existing design, that would introduce certain
	   advantages to the user in exchange for disadvantages elsewhere.
	   These would show up as adjustments to the rules and noted in the
	   description of the weapon.

3. The player and ref would agree on all of the device's capabilities and
limitations to preserve game balance, and the ref would be the final authority
in cases where it was felt that the devices was somehow being abused.

With these basic rules in mind, my players and I had a field day! Over the
past eleven years, I've ran people with all kinds of strange stuff.

AN EXAMPLE: THE HUNTER
Consider one fellow who was running a bounty hunter in one of my more Space
Opera-ish campaigns: he wanted a weapon that would give him a certain
signature, one that was instantly recognizable to anyone who saw it, so that
criminals would know that he was nearby and tremble (!). What we decided upon
was to give him a weapon similar to the guns used in the film Logan's Run (NOT
the design in the book; that was implemented elsewhere, for other reasons).
These guns were the epitome of the evil, uncaring death that the bounty hunter
carried with him: they spat green flame in four tongues surrounding the
barrel, and the victim erupted in green fire and died. What did that become in
terms of Traveller rules? Let's see:

1. First, the weapon's mode of operation had to be agreed upon. It was decided
that the device was a Gauss pistol, firing incendiary rounds that ignited
while still in the gun so as to be fully lit before impact (hence the flame
vents). Thus it was limited to worlds with TL 13 or greater, Law level below 1
(since the rounds were explosive) OR Law above 11 (then the gun would be in
the hands of the Thought Police or some such), and oppressive or dangerous
governments. I chose a suitable world, and told him that's where the gun was
made. It's his only source of spare parts, ammo, and power packs, so he gets
back there often or arranges for shipments to other worlds at a high cost.
If he runs low, getting to a supply source as his ammo supply dwindles becomes
an adventure in and of itself! |->

2. The gun, as mentioned above, would come under option "a", as it was
essentially an unusual design of Gauss pistol, with few, if any, major changes
in terms of effects in the rules. The primary advantage, as mentioned, was
psychological.

3. We agreed to run the weapon exactly as a Gauss pistol under the rules as
given in TRAVELLER, and no questions or quibbles were ever raised. (I secretly
noted the dangers inherent in shooting such a gun in areas full of flammable
vapors, but he seemed to understand the risks and never did anything stupid.)

The end result: a nifty, impressive weapon, that didn't mess up game balance,
but gave his character depth and recognition, both to NPCs and to his fellow
players:

"The thug stands over you, one foot on your gun wrist and the muzzle of his
pistol pointing at your face. He grins as he squeezes the trigger. Suddenly,
he looks up at the sound of a tiny footstep from behind you, and screams, "NO!
PLEASE!" There is an odd coughing noise, a burst of green fire, and he
collapses in agony, writhing on the concrete. A figure in black steps out of
the shadows; the Hunter has come through again."

Get the idea?

SOME MORE EXAMPLES: THE WEAPONS OF NEAR MISS
Near Miss, the characters of my GenCon adventures and the associated fiction
stories, have been adventuring for decades, and rely on their weapons for
their survival. Over the years, they've fine-tuned their own special needs,
for weapons that cover all of the bases properly. Some of them were satisfied
with traditional designs or minor alterations, while others had very specific
needs. So:

CAPTAIN CRISIS was a Navy fighter pilot. He knew that he could be downed in
hostile territory at any time, so he needed a weapon that would let him
survive and defend himself over a wide range of situations (mostly military)
yet be portable and easy to handle. The result was the Camberwell GP114,
nicknamed the "Hammerhead," a special Gauss Pistol developed for fighter
pilots. It was heavier and somewhat bulkier than normal Gauss pistols, but had
a gyro unit and a laser targeting sight installed. RULES: treat as Gauss
Pistol, but use "Scope," "Gyro," or "Scope+Gyro" task difficulties depending
on what the firer chooses to use. Note that the firer must be braced and
non-moving to use Gyro, and that Scope changes the weapon's signature to
Medium (it's a low-efficiency laser, with lots of lens scatter) and may not be
usable for snap fire (ref's discretion).

WINDY was a Scout Explorer. Her primary concerns were self-defense, hunting,
and survival, and she couldn't be bothered to carry both a rifle and a pistol
for field research. The Scout Exploration office issues, for such operatives,
the Stenhauser MVACW, a weapon that provides excellent hunting and defense
capability in a portable package. It's essentially a 9mm ACR with a very short
barrel and no shoulder stock, the bullpup-style magazine offset slightly to
allow the weapon to be held pistol-fashion. Long barrel and full stock can be
attached if desired. RULES: The Stenhauser, when fully set up with barrel,
scope, gyro and stock, is treated like any other ACR. However, the
barrel/stock unit (which is a one-piece device on a frame, not two separate
items) also contains the scope mount and the gyrostabilizer; when the action
and grip are detached from this, the gun uses the Handgun difficulty tables,
with no Scope or Gyro enhancements. Its maximum range is Medium due to the
short barrel, and damage and penetration are as normal for the type of ACR
ammo in use. Autofire is treated as for any other handgun with autofire
capability. (Use of both hands in controlling the weapon is advisable.)

COUNTDOWN specializes in explosives applications and demolitions. This makes
the Snub Pistol (revolver style) and ARL essentially perfect for her uses, but
there's an occasional need for something heavier. So she found an ARL with an
underbarrel RAM grenade launcher. RULES: The RAM GL is a typical 3-shot TL 13
model, and the ARL runs by the same set of rules as always, but weight and
encumbrance are slightly higher. The weapon may also be restricted at lower
Law Levels than would be normal for an ARL.

MOTORMUTT doesn't fight for a living, and he never has. The less he uses
weapons, the happier he is, so he limits himself to one single device that's
there when he needs it and able to handle just about any situation in which he
finds himself: a Stinger, essentially a TL 14 version of the Body Pistol using
Gauss technology. Tiny, silent, and deadly. RULES: Treat as Gauss Pistol, but
limit range to Medium, allow no autofire, and limit number of shots to five.
In exchange, allow greater concealability and improved DMs for snap fire.
Magazines and power packs are custom designs, and may be difficult to replace.
The weapon is not designed to avoid metal detectors.

DOCSHOCK specialized in psychoacoustic response science before SuSAG put him
to work as a Field Operations Specialist (read, industrial spy). His research
into nonlethal means of subdual led him to aid in the development of the
Marovcenko Sonic Stunner. RULES: The MSS is built as a modular plug-in
replacement for the flash tube of a TL 13 Laser Carbine, and can be converted
back to use as a Laser in four rounds if the extra tube is handy. As a sonic
weapon, it operates under the Neural Rifle rules, with no effectiveness in
vacuum or Very Thin atmospheres and increased likelihood of damaging Mishaps.
Its signature is High, not due to flash but to operating noise (a piercing
shriek that ranges from skin-crawling behind the cone of effect to eardrum-
shattering within it). Appicable skill is Lasers; he also carries an Integral
Laser Pistol.

LIGHTS wasn't supposed to be a fighter for a living, but her Captain insisted
on her at least learning to handle some weapon for ship defense, since Pursers
must often be pressed into service for antihijacking work. So she chose the
Shotgun, so as not to miss too often. The problem then became obtaining a
suitable sidearm: her solution was to buy a second shotgun and cut it down.
RULES: Range limited to Long, difficulty as Pistol, no rapid fire, failure
to stand and brace increases tasks by one level of difficulty, although a
two-handed grip suffices for "bracing" in most cases; number of shots limited
to five, and weapon falls under Handguns rather than Shotguns for Law Level
limitations. No detachable magazine; must be reloaded by hand, one shot per
combat round.

HUG was a warrior, plain and simple. He chose his weapons well, and used
others only when neccessary. These days, his LAG and Snub AutoPistols are
built by human gunsmiths to utilize easily available human-made spare parts,
but are designed for Aslan hands and ergonomics: the Snub Pistols, especially,
are strange-looking, as it is Aslan custom to mount the barrel UNDER the grip
for better recoil control! (If you don't believe this, look in the annals of
the NRA: A Soviet team was barred from rapid-fire pistol competition a number
of years ago, because their "upside-down" guns gave them a massive advantage
over the Americans and Europeans.) RULES: Increase repair tasks by one level
for all devices; increase all attempts by humans to use weapons by one level
of difficulty. No other changes, except for an optional Scope modifier for all
weapons (either optical, as for LAG, or a laser pointer, for Snubbies.)
[Ref's note: this last bit is still being worked on, as there's never been a
definitive statement on the ergonomics of Aslan tools and weapons as there has
been for most of the other races (it's known that Vargr hands work well with
the ovoid-cylindrical handles given to most human tools, and that Hivers
prefer to handle spheres of various sizes with their tentacles, for example).
This design may change after DGP gets through with the Aslan in their next few
issues; another possibility is a gun with two barrels, one over the grip and
one under it...the only worthwhile idea in the entire movie THE BLACK HOLE.]

TINKER can't be bothered with weapons at all; she's a technician. But there's
no law against modifying a Laser Welder for pulsed operation, is there?
RULES: On Pulse setting, treat as Laser rifle, no real modifications.
[A possible change to this character will replace the Laser with a device
that's more efficient both as a tool and as a weapon: a Powercutter, which
utilizes a plasma beam rather than laser light. A strong disadvantage to this
design, which has yet to be addressed adequately anywhere in the TRAVELLER
rules, is the weapon's signature: "High" is too weak a word. Plasma beams
(I've worked with a couple) are unbelievably bright; it's like staring into
the Sun! You can't get anywhere near them without going blind, unless your
eyes are heavily protected. And the waste heat in the vicinity is frightening;
I can't imagine using one of these without Battle Dress on.]

Anyway, I've gotten amazingly long-winded here, and I'm sorry; the Near Miss
gang are usually good models for anything you'll find in my campaign, and if
nothing else you can consider the above a partial introduction to them. |->
I hope that these guidelines prove worthwhile for you in keeping your technoid
players under control, and that your own campaigns can now bristle with
bizarre techno-rubble without coming completely apart.

I had always assumed that laser weapons _did_ have a targeting beam of

I would assume that the Hit would be automattic, but you would still have
to roll for aquisition. So I would run the first shot as normal just calling
the to hit roll an aquisition roll. To reaquire, you may have to develop
a system, like maybe the normal to hit +2 making it easier to reaquire the
target. This however would be conditional to how much damage and did the
target after getting fried, decide that it is far better to hide than
get ones brains fried just for fun.

Does this make sense?

Adrian:

It's a nifty idea, but there's only one problem: the fiber-optic cable itself.
I'm primarily involved with quantum optics on the theoretical level, and my
practical lab experience with lasers isn't as much as what I have with, say,
magnetic steering and bottling, but I can guarantee this: the idea will only
work (and this is a pretty lame caveat, I admit) if the next seven or eight
Tech Levels beyond ours have some amazing breakthroughs in fiber-optic
technology. Here's my reasoning:

For the novices, fiber optics works by designing a material that refocusses
divergent light energy "gently" back onto its original path. What this means
is that the light beam arrives at its destination in essentially the same form
as it left its source, and there is very little loss along the way (which is
why US Sprint is making such a big hooha about using them). The problem is
that there's no such thing as a "loss-free" cable; if there's any
quantum-level interaction between lased photons and the atoms of the cable,
and there HAS to be for the cable to operate at all, there will be an energy
loss in the form of waste heat. Now, for most applications, such as
telecommunications etc., this loss will be minimal, perhaps even immeasurable.
But when we start talking about the levels of power communicated by a good-
sized battlefield laser, things become more complicated.

At this point, we have to consider the problem of laser weapons themselves.
They're the most dangerous non-nuclear weapons in the Traveller arsenal, and
everyone likes to have one around, but how do they really work? It's
impractical to merely shoot a hole through someone: the high heat causes
instant cauterization of the wound, and if vital organs are missed the victim
may not even feel much pain. The concept behind the laser's effectiveness
comes in heat transfer and tissue trauma: the water in human cell tissue is
enormously efficient at absorbing and dissipating heat energy from radiative
input on the visible wavelengths, so when a human body stops a laser pulse, a
chunk of flesh about the size of a golf ball at the point of contact instantly
flash-heats into steam, rupturing cell walls, causing potentially fatal organ
hyperthermia, and exploding outward in a sudden burst that may take a great
deal of unheated flesh with it. The results are properly graphic for fans of
special effects  a la George Romero: a loud explosion and a burst of blood and
pink steam, with an action-reaction effect (since the exploding flesh acts
against the human body as a reaction mass) that can hurl the victim backward
as nicely as a high-velocity lead slug.

Lovely to look at, but how does this relate to fiber optics? Simple: If that
much energy is being output in a single impulse (to overload the body water's
ability to conduct heat away from the impact point swiftly enough to avoid a
steam-burst) down a fiber-optic cable, the cable will almost certainly melt
from the waste heat. The tradeoff between flexibility and sturdiness under
handling is a tricky one in fiber optics, and to the best of my knowledge no
one has yet tried to add extreme heat-impulse resistance into the equation. If
you shrug and say, "Well, at TL15 there'll be fibers that can handle it," then
your problem's solved. Or rather, it's just beginning, because a proliferation
of devices like this could make life difficult for both players and refs.

There are those who say that at high TL, personal lasers will be UV, X-ray, or
even gamma-ray devices. This is bull: unless you're trying to kill a guy with
radiation, these weapons are far more effective on inert metal objects than
they are on humans. The problem, again, is the radiative-heat absorption
properties of water. Water is dynamite at absorbing heat (hence cell damage)
from visible light, but is transparent at shorter wavelengths. So a shortwave
laser would pass through a human, causing severe radiation sickness but no
immediate fatal trauma. (And fiber-optic cables can't work on UV or Xrays;
their wavelengths are on the subatomic level, so atomic structures can no
longer bend or shape them. That's what makes Xray telescopes so difficult to
design.) The Xray laser being worked on by the DOD these days, remember, is
for shooting down missiles: metal have very different absorption properties
than people, and more energy output per photon is possible with shorter
wavelengths.

Anyway, those are my feelings on the subject. I'd get a bit twitchy on the
idea of letting a box like this into my game; I had a similar design in an old
campaign, rigged to a pointer glove rather than a pistol for aiming, and the
people who were able to get them wreaked havoc.

Let me know what you decide to do.

One of you has asked if you can tell/invite a Traveller friend of/to the

far as I am concerned.  Even people who aren't interested in Traveller
are welcome, as long as they can stand sitting next to people who are.
Don't invite anybody who might make lunch unappetizing, though (I

From: richard@agora.hf.intel.COM (Richard Johnson)



Adrian Hurt recently mentioned using laser target designation for
laser pistols.

I have always allowed this in my campaign.  I even let characters use
these things in the fog (and try to figure out why they are so quickly
spotted) and underwater (and wonder why there are steam explosions...).

Laser target designation works its best with beam weapons; there is no
ballistic drop.  (I know, I'm assuming your on a planet.)  The earlier
postings alluded to sophisticated software that would automatically
calculate "drop" and "windage" and adjust the electronic sights of your
assault rifle.  Of course the latter costs a LOT more.

- -------------------------------------------------------------
Now, how about the space-borne equivalent: software that calculates
the shifting of the target and refraction (and focusing) of the beam
caused by, say, a gravity lens and feeds this information to the
targeting computer?

Imagine tryng to find a ship that fired at an oblique angle and
literally bent the beam around a dense body to hit you.

  Hello all.

  This is actually in regards to the weapons debate, though I do have a
question for the list historian if he gets that far.

  In one of my previous games, we had a true point and shoot death beam in the
game.  We were all equiped to TL 17 or 18 before the DM knew what that meant.
He gave the entire merry band "power gloves."  As the name implies, you pointed
an appropriate digit at the offending being, vehicle, or starship that annoyed
you, and an appropriate blast of power removed it from the game.

  While the actual implementation was kinda lame (I can see all of the pocket
computers translating furiously), the idea was handy.  We used a target system
where the thing to be vaporized was telepathicly implanted in the firer's mind,
along with a BIG crosshair.  This gave a major plus on any aimed shot
(Essentialy adding about 20% to your chances to penetrate armor, more if you
had any skill) PLUS making any future shots occur at about a ten percent boost.
It was kind of fun in that it was both concealable and VERY nasty.  Applying
the idea to the proposed laser flashlight/ sword of Damocles, I would boost the
hit chance by a great deal on the first shot, possibly also upping the
penetration due to precision effects.  Later shots may get an advantage, but
the bad guy might decide to get the foo out of the way.

  For another view on this, see David Gerrold's creation in the Chtorr series.
In traveller terms, it would be an upscaled Gauss rifle, perhaps due to law
level restrictions on portable energy weapons, that had full electronic scope
sights and easier precision targetting.  In essence, the rifle sent out a guide
beam that the helmet picked up.  The frequency shifted by a nasty random series
set by some switches in both the gun and the helmet, thuis allowing the fierer
to see instantly where his or her shots were going, while only lighting up the
gun to standard sensors for millisecond flashes.  Still worse than no active
systems at all, and easy to defeat with enough sensing gear and computer power,
but pretty effective against those facing it.

  Metlay: (first name not currently at hand, sorry) What information exists
about Sternmetal Horizons.  In my game, they seem kind of like a bloodthirsty
K-Mart.  Thier equipment is very good for the tech level behind where one is,
thier training is laughable, but thier people are very well trained and
effective.  Almost like thier legal staff.

  Thanks.

Hi. Any ideas about the length of time involved in going from a
ship with only its power plant running for essential services
(lights, some computer functions, etc.) to a launch in a real hurry?
Specifically, the end of Legend of the Sky Raiders adventure, which
I shall be running for the third time (its fun). The idea is that the
characters take the ship by force while it`s sitting at the landing
sight and wish to leave as soon as possible. In addition, the pilot
in question is probably not familiar with the far trader and is certainly
not familiar with the current panel configurations as customized by
the ship's normal pilot. Thoughts?

Other:	Fuel=133,911 liters, Scoops, ObjSize=small,
		EmLevel=NONE
Notes: This is the "stealth" model of the popular Solomani
FM-44 fighter.  It is commonly deployed in system defense
squadrons or "intruder" squadrons designed to harrass enemy
shipping.

I used this little guy once in an adventure (my campaign is set in the
Spinward Marches) in the hands of a bunch of former Rachelites that SolSec
had sold them to.  They operated off a converted freighter (which I'll
upload if I can find the file anywhere) and hid in asteroid belts, near
gas giants, and in major shipping lanes with their systems powered most of
the way down and their EM maskers (read: cloaking devices) on.  When a juicy
target passed their way they'd surface, jam its transmissions and order it
to surrender.  Took the PC's quite a while to solve the mystery of the
mysteriously disappearing freighters.  I figured that with everything shut
off except the passive scanners, the life support systems, and the EM masker,
a dedicated (read: fanatical) pilot can stay on station just drifting for
over three months.  Hence the 100-day drift endurance.  I rationalized this
design by saying that the Solomani use this class for long-term patrol duties
(suddenly surfacing in case of intruders) and for commerce raiding as above.
Hence the reason to put a bunk on a 20-ton fighter...

Solomani FM-44E "Phantom" space control fighter
CraftID: Missile fighter, Type FM, TL 14, MCr 33.845
Hull: 	18/45, Disp=20, Config=6AF, Armor=40G,

Other:	Fuel=137,911 liters, Scoops, ObjSize=small,

Notes: This is the standard-issue navy model of the FM-44.

Nifty tricks like EM masking aren't really necessary in a straight up-and-down
fight, so I figured the Solomani would need a more conventional version better
optimized for ship-to-ship combat than the D model (which is more like a mini
spacegoing submarine).  Anyway, I don't know if either of these designs will
be of use to anyone, but I thought I'd share them just in case and to increase
the list's inventory of ship designs.

Consider the amount of time it takes to get your average airliner off the
ground, starting with everything off. The time is probably on the order of
an hour or so, more if you are unfamiliar with the ship.

A starship is still a very complicated piece of equiptment, and takes a long
time to start up. When your average jump takes 3 weeks, nobody really cares
that it takes a couple of hours to launch...

Scott:

No first name here. Just "Metlay." But thanx for the thought....

As for Sternmetal, they have a rather poor reputation in the GDW universe,
perhaps unfairly. Since the very first adventures, where the whole concept
of the megacorporations was still in its infancy and the GDW folx needed to
create a "big faceless corporate bad guy" entity, Sternmetal has been the
butt of more than its share of villain roles, and incompetent ones at that.
This is sad, because there's no way they could have grown to the level of power
that they currently enjoy if they were always as incompetent as they've been
made out to be. If you'd like, I can delve into my back issues of JTAS and my
old books and dig up some details about them; they're not really a merchan-
dising firm, but specialize instead in raw materials recovery and processing.
(This contributes to their bad reputation, as they have a tendency to leave
planets in unpleasantly befouled states.) If you want a K-mart for Average
Stellar Tech items (but one which is by NO means incompetent), I'd suggest
Ling-Standard Products.

Any other questions?

Two possibilities: the ship either already has its fusion plant online or it
doesn't.  Most ships with fusion plants leave them running if they park for
less than about a week or so (I haven't seen the adventure you're running, so
I don't know what circumstances this A2 is in) because it takes so long to
bring the power plant up from a cold start.  In any event, the UTP for what
they're trying to do looks like this:

    To power up a parked starship and ready it for flight:
    Routine, Pilot, Dex, 30 sec (assuming warm start, 5 min otherwise)

If you're still using the old rules (the new ones are well worth it!), the pilot
needs to roll a 7+ to start the plant.  DMs: +Pilot skill, +1 if Dex 5+ or +2
if Dex 10+.  It will take 3d6x30 sec (an average of about 5 minutes) to start
if successful (or 3d6x5 min for an average of 50 (!) minutes if the A2 is
powered all the way down).  MegaTraveller gives rules for unfamiliar technology
but since I don't know what background your pilot has I'd simply suggest about
a -2 DM or so heaped on top of this.  If he fails the roll, he'll have to take
another time increment and do it again.

Oh, and also: I'm assuming that since your PC's are presumably in a rush, they
will skip the usual safety checks and such.  In which case, when they start the
ship, you should make a roll along with them.  If you both succeed, everything
is fine but if they succeed and you fail, you should implement a "warning light"
event about halfway to orbit (i.e. a plant malfunction, fuel leak, or the like)
that will require a harder, fateful task to avoid a major mishap.

Finally, if things get hot and your PC's need to get out of there in a hurry,
they can try to rush things a bit.  Double the DM's applied to the startup roll
but instead of a 7+ they now need to roll an 11+.  And so do you.... :-)

Oh, and I almost forgot: if anybody has Engineering skill, it can be used as a
DM as well.

With all of the recent interest in the star system generation
programs, I would like to get the star system discussion group
going again. I remember (way back when :-) that James Perkins
and Fred Schiff were discussing the developement of their
program to generate sectors and subsectors with PostScript
output on hex paper.

Our main topics of discussion would be:

     - What referees and players would like to see in a (generic)
       sector/subsector/planet generation program,
     - The design of these programs, and whether they should be one
       program or several programs in one system,
     - The necessary data needed to keep consistency between
       each generation system,
     - Expansion of any system generation program in scope/scale
       (eg. to include planetary maps of generated worlds, maybe
       down to the 'city' level).
     - Modification of James' (with his permission) and the existing
       'real' system generation programs to incorporate new functions,
       capabilities, and data items.

We will add other topics as soon as they are mentioned. Please note
that the 'expansion' item above is *very* ambitious with the amount
of time available (I assume that most readers have jobs and/or
school?) to use?

We are looking for programmers, physics/astrophysics/astronomy
experts, biologist, SoRag agents, and anyone else who is
interested and has ideas about system generation (alright, even
if you don't have ideas on system generation we could use you).

This will be a sub-discussion group with myself as moderator, and
I'll post digests (just like the Trade & Commerce group) of the
discussion to the rest of the traveller mailing list. So if you're

     In The Eight Worlds (my Traveller-like game), a starship can be in
any one of six states of readiness.  The nature, consequences, and
transition times between these states are:

     DOWN- Cold, lifeless, inert, and covered with dust:
     "Well, she flew pretty good ten years ago, but she's been sitting
in the shed since then."

     COLD- On battery power and ready for opperational use.
     "We rented a 'dozer an' pushed 'er out to the pad.  'Arry filled the
air tanks an put new filters in the lifesystem.  Got a bit covered with
sludge an 'e's not to 'appy bout that let me tell ya.  Arnie poked 'round
around Engineering an' says that looks pretty good.  'Arold replaced some
cracked boards in the avionics suite.  Sheila put new seat covers on all
all the crash couches.  We put 'er on battery power and nothing broke so
I guess she's OK.  The whole job took about three weeks where's our cash?"

     RESERVE- Fusors up, drives ready, ship pre-flighted and on internal
power.  Reserve consumes a detectible but negligable amount of fuel and
resources.  Reserve status also requires a small maintenance crew,
whisically refered to as the 'anchor watch'.
     "Right boys, this is an old ship, no telling what we'll find, let's
tear this thing apart ourselves.

     "Aye Cap'n?"
     "Go through the ENTIRE Engineering checklist before you pump down
the fusors and drives, and make sure the power conditioning equipment

co-ordinate things up on the bridge.

     LOW STANDBY- Engineering systems on line at low power, ship ready to

has been completed.  Low Standy consumes moderate amounts of fuel (about
1% what is used in normal opperations) to run the fusor and to circulate
through the various cooling systems.
     "Bridge, Engineering, Johnathan here, ready to flash the fusors."
     "Alert, this is the Bridge, all crew to damage control stations and

     [jumble of acknowledgements]

     [Hurt sultry voice] "They should have been delivered by now Captain.
Oh, look I see the truck arriving now.  Permission to leave the bridge?"
     "Granted."

     STANDBY- Ready for takeoff.  Even though the drives are not running
(in fact, in the Eight Worlds, fusion drives can not be used if the
external atmospheric density is greater than 1.0E-15 atoms/cc or they
will explode, BOOM, with a consequent reduction in the ship's opperational
capabilities.  Atmospheric flight is accomplished through the use of
thermal scramjets driven by heat from the fusor), Standby consumes
considerable amounts of fuel, about 10% what is used in normal opperations,
but a ship can be lifted from Standy in the time it takes to spool the
lifters.
     A ship can also be lifted from Low Standby in an emergency.  This
involves omitting the pre-takeoff checklist, and thus any chance of
discovering if there is something wrong with the vessel (In Eight Worlds
game mechanics, I roll dice before each liftoff to determine if there
is a malfunction in any of the ship systems.  This chance depends on
the quality of the vessel.  If the crew perform their pre-takeoff
checklist, they get a chance, dpependant on the relevant skills, to
detect and prevent the malfunction before it occurs.  If they fail to
do this, they must prevent the malfunction after it occurs, which is
considerably more difficult and entertaining.)

Could it also be that they want to give that impressoin(of incompetance)?

After all if you think they are incompitant, then how much time are you
going to spend thinking up plans to put them out of the picture?  Alot less

RE: Paul Gazis

Your descriptions of different states of readiness seems to overlap some.
RESERVE implies that the powerplanet 'fusors' are running, but the description
does not match.

RESERVE- Fusors up, drives ready, ship pre-flighted and on internal  power.

LOW STANDBY- Engineering systems on line at low power, ship ready to  lift
after drives and fusors have been warmed up and pre-takeoff checklist  has been
completed.

In my mind, there should be the states:

DEAD         :  No energy being generated or used:
BATTERY POWER:  Battery power is available.  Doors, life support, lighting,
                controls may be turned on or off.  Computer will drain
                batteries within an hour if used.
BATTERY DIAG :  Normally a set of diagnostics are run on battery power before
                bringing up the main power plant.  Takes 5-15 minutes.
POWER CHARGE :  Charge the power plant in preperation to starting it.
                Can take minutes to hours depending on TL.
POWER START  :  Main fusion power plant is running at minimum capacity.  Full
                power is available within a moment.  Computer is available.
POWER DIAG   :  Normally a set of diagnostics are run to fully check the ship's
                systems.  Takes an hour or more.
MANEUVER WARM:  Apply power to the maneuver drives and ready for full power.
                Takes a moment.
GRAVITY START:  Ship's gravitics lift off the ship from the surface.
MANEUVER START: Ships's maneuver drives produce appropriate thrust at
                appropriate altitude.
JUMP DIAG    :  Diagnostics are run for the Jump Drive.
JUMP WARM    :  Minimum energy is applied to the Jump Drive.
JUMP DIAG    :  Diagnostics are run again for the Jump Drive.
JUMP START   :  The Jump Drive is energized, and the ship transfers to jump space.
JUMP MAINT   :  Jump Drive runs to maintain Jump.
JUMP STOP    :  Jump Drive is ??? to exit Jump.

most ships are kept at POWER STARTed state if they are going to be used within
the next month, or if there is crew aboard.  Naturally, the diagnostic steps
can be skipped.  The drives can each also be cold started with significant
chances of failure.

Hi everyone,

I am somebody who has been away from the game Traveller for a while and has
been somewhat surprised by all the changes. (Guass Pistols?!?!? What'll they
come up with next?)

Being a rabid C programmer both by trade and as a hobby I am always working
on programs to automate things, in particular stuff like table lookup and
such.

I know that there are "projects" underway for program development for
Traveller.   What stage are they in and what needs to be written?  I am
making myself available.

Subject: Zhodani & Psionics Information?



Hello out there in the Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate...

	Does anybody out there know anything about the Zhodani, or
about any expansion rules for Psionics?  Just curious, I'm now playing
a Zhodani Nobleman psionic in our local traveller game.  We've got the
module, Expedition To Zhodane, and I've got Journal #23, with Zhodani
Philosophies.  I *used* to have the Zhodani Alien Module (#4).  For the
longest time it was lying around collecting dust because I was hardly
ever playing traveller, and when I was I wasn't playing Zhodani, and now
that I finally need it, I can't find it!  (I *think* I leant it to some-
body...)

	I'm thinking of writing a little expansion for psionics - not
to increase the power, but to fill in some gaps that seem to be in the
rules (telepathy, for example, jumps from skill 5 strength 2 sending
thoughts to skill 9 strength 9 probing...  what about the skills and
strengths in between?) and to add some techniques for using existing
psi abilities ("flickerscanning" for example, using sense thoughts by
skimming rapidly through a large crowd of people looking for key thoughts
or intentions - after which the psi would follow-up with a direct sense
thoughts) and some non-psi techniques for dealing withh psis ( the "jingle"
method of keeping your mind from being read, from Alfred Bester's _The
Demolished Man_).  Maybe (very iffy) some new minor technologies that
can be used by psis (psionically sensitive material that can have a message
or image psionically imprinted on it).  Any other thoughts occur?

Most of that is concerned with safety, and especially air traffic control -
waiting for your turn to take off. The question says "in a real hurry", so a
more valid comparison would be with a fighter getting scrambled. Anyone

     The heart of the matter.  Yes, you have chosen fine states.  They
are goodly states indeed.  I will be the first to admit that your states
are every bit as good as mine.  Maybe better.  However...
     Your states appear to be chosen on the basis of crew activities,
mine were chosen on the basis of power consumption and drive functionality.
Other possibilities exist as well (weapons functionality, avionics status,
opperational level of the Feel-O-Tron, etc.)  The particular choice of
opperational states would seem to depend upon the nature of the starcrew
subculture, the availability of Feel-O-Trons, and the whimsy of the GM.
A martial culture may only be concerned with the weapons.  A race of
hedonists may wait in line for the Feel-O-Tron.  Eight Worlds ships are
TERRIBLY fuel limited so fuel management becomes THE overriding issue.
     And oh yes I forgot.  Fuel consumption and power level also
determine the extent to which the ship is visible to passive sensors.
This has, at times, been a matter of supreme importance.

TECHNICAL NOTE:
     There are no GRAVITICS in the Eight Worlds universe.  Eight Worlds
spacecraft are propelled by reaction drives, the way the gods meant Man
to propel spacecraft.  No inertial compensation either.  Grunt snort.
     There are also no Feel-O-Trons in the Eight Worlds, to the dismay
of PCs who think that this would be an acceptible alternative to
inertial compensation.

About starships, airliners, and fighter planes:

Northrop claims that an F-20 can go from sitting on the runway with the pilot
drinking coffee to 20,000 feet and firing missiles at incoming enemy bombers in
less than a minute.  We can reasonably assume it takes about twice that long.
The MegaTraveller rules state that it takes 3d6 X 30 seconds to warm-start the
fusion plant on a parked starship or small craft, which works out to about 5
minutes.  If you add in safety checks like you're supposed to, you have to make
a Cautious task attempt, which means it takes twice as long, or 10 minutes.
Once we add in taxi and takeoff times, it appears that spacecraft in Traveller
take about as long to take off if they're following traffic control rules as
our airliners do.

Let's examine a typical Traveller case of a PC group in a hurry to take off.
Scout Susan Blaire is surveying a Tech Level 0 world.  She leaves her Type/S
Scout/Courier in "low fuel consumption park" mode as she plans to move on to
another continent the next day.  While outside her ship, she encounters natives
of the Ooga-Booga tribe (a minor race of humaniti).  While conversing with their
Grand High Poobah by use of her CLT, she rolls a fumble and manages to offend
His High Grumpiness.  Her attempt to patch things up (a hazardous, fateful
Liason test) results in a Destroyed mishap.  She decides to run for her life.

She manages to get back to her ship 2 1/2 minutes ahead of the pursuing savages.
Crash-starting her scout ship requires a Routine, Pilot, Dex, 30 sec.  Letting
TL 0 savages see a TL 15 scout ship is against Scout Service regulations, so
she decides to rush things a bit.  Her dexterity of 10 and her Pilot skill of 2
combine to give her a +4 DM on the task attempt.  Normally she would need a 7+
since this is a routine task, but since she's making a hasty attempt the
difficulty goes up one level, to an 11+.  She rolls a 7 (which converts to an
11 by her +4 DM), indicating success.  She rolls an 12 for her time roll, which
would normally mean a time of six minutes.  But because of the hasty task
attempt, she subtracts twice her DM's from the roll, for a total of 4, meaning
it takes her two minutes to get her scout off the ground.  Thirty seconds later,
the Ooga-Boogas rush into the clearing where she had been parked, only to find
her mysteriously gone.  Such are the ways of the gods...

Notice that in the above example, it took about as long to get the scout ship
off the ground as it does to scramble a typical fighter plane.  However, in her
rush to get off the ground to avoid a code break, Sue forgot her safety checks,
making her task attempt uncertain.  Unless the referee also rolls a 7 or better,
Sue might just find herself stranded on this TL 0 planet... such are the risks
you take in lifting in a big hurry.

RE: "There are no GRAVITICS in the Eight Worlds universe.  Eight Worlds
    spacecraft are propelled by reaction drives, the way the gods meant Man  to
    propel spacecraft.  No inertial compensation either.  Grunt snort."

My inclusion of gravity drive was done for a couple of reasons:

Traveller spaceships assume that there is some kind of artificial gravity for
the living quarters orientation at least.  The rules sort of assume that except
for fighters, all ships have artifical gravity.  If they have artificial
gravity, I assume that it's strength can be varied.  It may not be dymanic
enough to cushion a crash, but it can certainly be set to some static value to
counteract acceleration.

I have yet to fathom how the majority of Traveller ships land and take off with
out some kind of gravity or auxiliary thrusters.  Take the scout ship, which
has the drive in the stern, yet lands horizontally.  How does it take off or
land in a wilderness as a scout should be able to do?  Since Traveller ships
obviously have some gravitics, why not use some form of gravity drive for at
least the initial liftoff?

I wish Traveller would either explictly define the spaceships gravity drive, or
explain how these ships land and take off without them.  And allow for ships
designs with and without the gravity drives.

According to the REFEREE'S COMPANION, maneuver drives work by combining
gravitics and nuclear dampers technology.  The strong molecular force is
manipulated by a grav field to push against large plates mounted in the
stern of the ship.  Presumably, although the thruster plates themselves
lack the projective capabilities of grav modules, the grav modules that
are in the m-drive are used by themselves to lift the ship off the ground.
Once airborne, the ship then switches to the thruster plates for primary
locomotion.  That's how a type/S with its thruster plates in the stern can
land on a planet on its belly.

The new Starship Ops Manual from DGP addresses this matter; it seems that
thruster plates have a limited but usable efficiency in other directions
than straight back, so a ship with thrusters in back can lift straight up
if its engines are powerful enough.

Usually what's done is that the ship lifts in a horizontal attitude, slowly
tilts back in midair until it points straight up, then boosts. The reverse
process is used for landing. (Alternatively, if there's an air-traffic hold
pattern, horizontal flight is also possible.)

I thought that the starship operators' guide explaned a lot of these
areas such as take-off procedures and gravitics. I haven't read this
in several months, so I may be mistaken...

Has anyone else seen the new MegaTraveller book "World Builder's guide"
(I think that is the exact title...It is difficult to think of these things
when they are on the shelf at home, and I am at work.) I have caught
at least 5 minor errors, and several differences between the examples

Greetings fellow travellers;

I am getting ready to start up a new campaign, and have a small problem.
There will be a lot of spacecraft the players will be interacting with,
and I don't want to have to lug around a ton of books.  I was wondering
if there are any programs available that would let me either read in a
set of plans (using a scanner) or enter the plans in some way, store
them in a database, and let the players or myself recall them and/or
print them out as we need.  I would prefer it to work on a pc on a CGA
( :-(  card at a minimum (ega or vga preferred), but do have a Macintosh
available if there is software there.  I do not want suggestions such as
"Use Macdraw or MacPaint".  I am looking for something a bit more
oriented towards what I want it to do.  I also am not interested in
AutoCAD, since it costs $ 3000.

       EIGHT WORLDS DRIVE SYSTEMS AND FLIGHT OPPERATIONS

Drine Systems
     Eight Worlds physics does not seem to allow for gravitics
technology.  Eight worlds ships have three drive systems:

     1) Hyperdrive.  Hyperdrive relieves much of the tedium of
interstellar travel, provided that no attempt is made to employ
it too near an interfering mass.  If this precaution is omitted,
the ship explodes, relieving ALL the tedium of interstellar flight.
The minimum distance at which hyperdrive can be employed without
explosive consequences (the infamous 'jump limit') is dependant
upon the intrinsic curvature of space, which quantity is, of
course, equivalent to local tidal forces.  Thus, the jump limit is
proportional to the cube root of the interfering mass.
     The jump limit for a terrestrial mass is about 1.0E+06 km.
The jump limit Sol is somewhere around the orbit of Mercury.  Or
perhaps Venus.  Who cares?  Both are worthless rocks.  The point
is that hyperdrive CAN be used for intrasystem transit, should one
wish to travel to Io to replenish one's sulphur supply.  This is NOT
the case in a system of habitable planets in orbit around a star of
type M or smaller.  Which had important strategic consequences after
the collapse of the Imperium.
     Hyperspace jumps appear to conserve momentum.  Certain aspects
of hyperspace jumps appear to allow for violation of causality, but
the relevant experiments are beyond the finacial capacity of any
existing civilization.
     2) Fusion drives.  These are open core magnetic confinement
fusion reactors which function as high specific impulse reaction
drives.  (The most common configuration is a leaky tandem mirror
machine which burns D + D -> Useless Hot Junk.  The Useless Hot Junk
heats reaction mass to provide thrust.)  Fusion drives are are used
for planetary approaches and departures, to match velocity with a
destination, and for Space Laser Tag, a fast-paced competitive sport
with a simple and easily understood scoring system which is quite
popular beyond the Frontier.
     Drives are not particularly useful without associated structure
to keep the ship from collapsing.  I lump the mass and cost of the
load-bearing structure in with the mass and cost of the drives.  An
interesting consequence of this approach is that it does not matter how
much acceleration the ship pulls.  The structure of a 200 tonne ship
with 200 tonnes of cargo accelerating at 2 Gs is under the same load
(4 MNewtons) if the ship dumps its cargo and flees at 4 Gs.  The crew,
however, may notice a subtle change in their level of squishedness.
     Since fusion drives have open cores, they can't be used inside
an atmosphere lest the atmosphere leak in around the sides of the
plasma column, induce heavy-ion instabilities, and cause the ship
to explode boom.
     3) Atmospheric drives.  These are commonly known as 'Lifters',
and consist of an assortment of thermal turbojets and scramjets
driven by waste heate from the power plant.  (Eight worlds power
plants are closed core high-field magnetic confinement devices
which commonly use the D + Li6 -> 2He4 cycle.  The energetic alpha
particles are then run through an MHD generator.  No muss, no fuss,
no radiation, and if there are any leaks in the system the crew all
sound like Donald Duck.  It's great.)  Lifters are used to lift off,
tool around the planet, depart the atmosphere, or land.  In the hands
of unskilled crew, lifters can also be used to crash.
     Since lifters are part of the technology necessary to land on
a planet, I lump them in with streamlining, along with the aeroshell,
stabilizing fins, landing jacks, and paint job.  The thrust limitation
for lifters is imposed by the ship's load-bearing structure.  There
is no obvious benefit to attaching a 200 MNewton lifter system to
a ship which can only stand 8 MNewtons of thrust.

Flight Opperations
     This is, of course, all very great and keen and all, but does not
answer the question 'How do you land these things?'  (A question I have
often asked while landing my hang glider.)
     Most Eight Worlds ships are tail-landers (The drives are aligned
along the aerodynamic axis of the ship and they land on their tails...
What WERE you thinking!)  This is a fine and dandy configuration which
has been used successfully on any number of wierd experimental aircraft
back during the 1950s when they didn't know any better.  There was
also a bizarre proposal to build a tail-landing version of an F-16
for use on small naval vessels.  Ick.  Tail landers are not all THAT
hard to land (my hang glider is arguably a tail lander if it is landed
correctly.  At other times it is a nose lander), but they can fall over
once they are on the ground.  The usual cause of such accidents is
soil failure, which grows more likely as the weight, and hence the
ground pressure of the ship, increase.  The maximum safe weight for
landing a tail-lander on a compacted dirt field is 400 tonnes, which
co-incidentally is the size of most Eight Worlds trading ships.  My
my.  Another cause of toppling incidents are careless PC starcrew who
land their ship on a 45 degree slope.  It was fun, it was great, you
should have been there.
     An alternative configuration is a belly-lander.  Belly-landers have
their primary drives aligned along the aerodynamic axis, but possess
an additional set of lifters or a thrust vectoring scheme which allows
them to hover in a horizontal orientation.  That this scheme is feasible
is proven by one of NASA's AV-8 Harriers which even now is hovering
outside my window producing a terrible racket and making it difficult
to do any serious work.  Belly-landers are more stable on the ground,
a field which can handle a tail-lander can handle a belly-lander of 2-3
times the size.  With their extra lifters they are also a tad more
manuverable in the atmosphere.  But belly-landers have two problems:
     1) There is an extra mass and cost penalty, equal to 50% the cost
of streamlining.  This penalty has proven prohibitive for small ships,
which do not need belly-landing gear anyway so who cares.
     2) The coffee mugs fall off the shelves.  This problem is generic
generic to all Eight Worlds ships when they make the transition from
space to atmospheric flight, but it is much worse for belly-landers
since it persists after they are on the ground.  Eight Worlds ship
designers use lots of velcro, and draw heavily on 1950s Sci Fi flicks
for their deck plans.  The results are agreed by all to be somewhat
unsatisfactory.

More Flight Ops
     Nope.  No more flight ops.  I lied.

Dan & Adrion,

I had just *assumed* that were were using low-power aiming mode on our

A current riot-control assault rifle has a VISIBLE-red aiming laser slung under
the barrel -- the red bouncing dot tends to having a calming effect on the

For efficient transfer of energy from battery to victim, i suspect killing
lasers *are not* in the visible spectrum.  The only operaiontal deathray
I know of today, in man-aimable form, is a Maser -- called a navy gunnery
target designation radar.  Technicians supposedly adjust its iron sights by
aiming at a seagull (*Never an albatross!*) and squeezing the "trigger".
Basically a high-power, lasing, radar gun that produces instant oven

	Generating major orbital-scale maps: one planet with

	Generating maps of planets, continents etc.  complete with

I think somewhere in the Traveller rules, it is mentioned that only ships
with a certain configuration (needle/cone and wedge) can take off and land
on planets with an atmosphere.  It seems to me that because they
are aerodynamic, they must be able to take off and land horizontally.  This
could be why scouts only need to have drives in the rear.

But (now for the bit where I demolish my own argument), this doesn't work
in worlds with gravity and no atmosphere, where it won't be possible to get
enough lift for horizontal flight.  So possibly some kind of launch ramp could
be used as a compromise between horizontal and vertical lift off (this of
course raises the question of uninhabited zero atmosphere planets....).

     I  have only recently become aware of the Traveller  mailing
list but have devoted many hours to creating Traveller  software.
So by means of introduction I will list some of the things I have
worked  on. Interested parties please e-mail me and if  there  is
enough general interest I will post it to the list.
     Most  of  the  code  is fairly  portable  as  it  was  first
developed under Berkely Unix then ported to a MS-DOS PC.

                    jaymin@maths.tcd.ie
                    jaymin%maths.tcd.ie@cunyvn.cuny.edu

     LANGUAGES. I was always annoyed that the original  Traveller
didn't have language generation for English (Villani). So after a
series  of programs I now have one that will take a  given  text,
parse  it  in repeated passes and try to find  the  best  fitting
syllabic pattern. It then effectively generates a table like  the
standard  ones.  There is another trivial program  that  actually
generates  the words. It worked well on English,  brilliantly  on
Maori; I am unqualified to judge the results on German and  Irish
but  it  couldn't adequately parse Latin. Its  assumptions  about
syllables occurring independently within a word just don't work.

     YET  ANOTHER CHARACTER GENERATOR. I am sure it doesn't  have
much  over the others but the one nifty feature it does  have  is
that you can set the interaction level. I.e. you can specify that
the  computer is to make the decisions as to what cascade  skills
to pick up to even choosing when to muster out, etc.

     SCALED  HEX MAPPING. The idea is to design a map at  several
different  scales.  You can go up to the  largest,  mark  several
hexes  as hills, go down a few levels and add the finer  details.
It turned out not to be as useful as I first thought.

     YET  ANOTHER  TRADE PROGRAM. Handles what is  available  and
keeps a record of where you have been. Not very sophisticated.

     YET   ANOTHER  SYSTEM  GENERATOR.  Scouts  expanded   system
generator. Not much more I can say.

     ZAP. I started ZAP back in college shortly after Elite  came
out.  I  liked the trading and exploration aspect  of  Elite  and
strove  to come up with something similar. It uses  the  galactic
co-ordinates  as a random seed and the system for that  area  (if
there  is  one)  is generated from that.  Add  a  simple  density
function  and I have literally an entire galaxy of stars  even  I
know nothing about.
     System  generation and ship construction are  done  although
the  latter is not like Traveller. Trading is there but not  very
well  done.  I  had a combat section done but it  seems  to  have
disappeared.  Due  to  time pressures its  development  has  been
rather  slow  over  the  last two years. I want  to  be  able  to
generate maps of planets next but am having difficulty coming  up
with  a  good  enough representation (more  of  that  in  another
posting).
     I  would dearly like for someone to volunteer to  take  over
development of it. Or best a group development of modules for  it
al    la   'nethack'   centrally   co-ordinated   (Anyone    read
'Planiverse'?). Anyone who might be interested in doing odd  bits
please e-mail me and perhaps the mailing list might want to adopt
it.

Mostly true, depending on what you mean by "cold start". From what I
remember when I was in the Navy, if you include the inspections,
preventive maintenance, etc in that, it could take weeks regardless
of what type of power plant you have. However, lets assume that
all of that is out of the way, and that a "cold start" means
that you're ready to push the button to star the engines to
generate power. Both nuclear and boiler plants on ships generate
steam to turn the turbines. Generating the temperatures and
pressures for a steam plant average about 8 hours to get to operating
capacity. However, the new gas turbine (read: jet engine) ships
can be underway in about 30 seconds from when the button is pressed.

>From this, you can project technology to get engines that start in
as long or as short a time as you want (yes, I said all of that
just for this). You may want to consider the purpose of the ship
in determining the cold start time, and whether you want to count
inspections or not (if someone is stealing a ship, did the
predessors, inspect it?), etc.

Just some things to think about

Along the lines of random life forms:  One of my old campaigns (about 10 years
ago) did not even make the assumption that all sentient life forms would be
human/humanoid.  Two planets side-by-side could have totally divergent races.
To generate the sentient creatures I used a set of rules from a TSR space game
(the name of which I forget at the moment) for this purpose.   I got life form
types from those rules of everything from humanoids to spiders and everything
in between.

I have dealt with this problem in my game (VERY modified version) by having
four kinds of potentially aerodynamic vehicles.  The first is a lifting body
(i.e. brick-with-wings space shuttle design).  The second is a needle (i.e.
1950's rocket w. fins, or something similar).  The third is a stealthed hull
(kind of like a lifting body in shape).  The fourth is a lander (closer to
the LEM than anything else, although another good example is the big moon
lander in 2001).  I don't believe in gravity control, etc., so all of these
have to deal with with standard spacecraft dealing with gravity problems.
The only one that is a tail-lander is the lander model; the others have to
deal with the "coffee mugs fall off the shelves problem."  (Actually, my
description of the problem is a little more hideous--all the toilets turn
90 degrees; one hopes that landing procedures includes turning off the
plumbing for a while, or at least moving modular units into new non-spill
positions.)

Of course, since about 95% of the population in my game world (200 billion
to 500 billion per average solar system, and sometimes a lot more) lives in
space habitats, and most inhabited planets have their own elaborate shuttle
systems (very useful to keeping out smugglers, terrorists, etc.) this is
not a common problem for players.  (When it is, they velcro the coffee mugs
to the wall and turn off the plumbing for a few hours.)  Usually, your
spacecraft docks at a habitat's spaceport or sits a few hundred kilometers
away if the docking berths are all taken and a space gig comes out to your
ship and shuttles you into the habitats.

NEW TOPIC.  How many people run adventures in large habitats (my typical
large habitat is a rotating cylinder affair 15 km. at the base and 60 km.
from end to end; at each end is an "endwall complex" of enclosed levels
for industries, apartments, etc.--imagine about 700 shopping malls stacked
on top of one another and you'll have a rough idea; the endwall levels
are about 100 m. wide so you get a huge amount of internal space from them--
plus a "dayside," the landscaped interior of the cylinder.  The whole
thing supports about one million people; with the endwall complexes included
the internal surface area is about 4800 square km., of which roughly three
quarters (or two thirds of 3600 square km. if you use narrower endwall levels)
is "indoor" or endwall complex, and the remainder "outdoor" or dayside,
the latter being used for farms, parks, wilderness preserves, etc.)?
Personally, I am satisfied with a set-up that I find plausible, and I have
found that while microworlds have some limitations (anyone who specialized
in Field Artillery is going to fill a bit left out since using howitzers
inside a habitat is generally considered a bad idea), a million-person
setting can give you some remarkably complex adventure scenarios, and is
a little easier to map out than a billion-person world.  When you finish
one adventure in one habitat, of course, you can always move on to another.
(I assume that in many cases you will get a few hundred to several thousand
habitats clustered around a big asteroid or a large moon--the main source
of raw materials--and they will form a general political alliance.  The
result is that my universe is one where most people live in the galactic
version of an archipeligo.)  Any comments, questions, suggestions?

This is a very long file about gravitics.


The following information is highly UN-official.  I have taken

what I know about MegaTraveller from the rules and accessories,
but am not about to guarantee an official approval of any of it.

You can use and distribute this material freely, so long as I

(and while your at it, remember to thank JamesP and Tek for the

Some of this is still pretty rough, but I think you'll find

Gravitics in MegaTraveller
- ------by Richard Johnson

It is a misconception among several of my players that the
primary function of gravitics on space vessels is to hold
crew members to the deck.  I suspect this attitude is common.
In actuality (sic) the science of gravitics has profound
implications for space travel, and the development of
gravitics has been a primary mover the direction of space
technology.

The "Starship Operator's Manual, vol 1" gives, on page 56,
under "Gravitics Technician", introduces the idea of
gravitics.  It states that:

"The artificial grav plates and inertial compensators
within the ship are not critical to its performance...
More importantly, though, the maneuver drive's thruster
plates operate on a principal that takes advantage of
gravitic science..."

This article explores the theory and applications of gravitics,
and how gravitic design limitations affect the maneuvering of
space vessels.  I strongly suggest you read the appropriate
sections of the operator's manual, and information about ship
design in the Referee's manual, to better understand what I'm
saying here (and to catch me where I've blown it).

- ----------------------------------

Theory of Gravitics:

Two fundamental properties of matter concern us when space
vessels maneuver.  These are inertia and gravity.  Inertia is
the tendency for matter to resist any changes in speed or
direction.  Gravity is the tendency for all matter to attract
other matter (or anti-matter, for that matter).  It is
important to understand that these are *fundamental properties*.
All that exists demonstrates these tendencies; in fact, inertia
and gravity are what we use to define matter.

Both inertia and gravity are effects that we see, in "normal
space", of matter being highly concentrated energy (1).  Energy
concentrations sufficient to create solid matter are more than
enough to interact with higher-order universal dimensions (2).
These particles interact in higher dimensions in ways not
possible in "normal space".  The *effects* of these
hyperspacial interactions are then seen in "normal space" as
inertia and gravity. (3)

- ------------------------------

Gravitic Devices:

There are four basic gravitic devices:

Maneuver drives
Repulsers
Grav plates, and
Inertial compensators.

These all tap into these hypserspacial interactions, and
concentrate and direct the resulting force.  In a sense,
so do jump drives, but there is a critical distinction.
Jump drives use the hyperspace/space-time interactions
to loft the entire ship into a bubble in hyperspace,
while gravitic devices use the hyperspace/space-time
interactions to manipulate space-time events.

Drives and repulsers generally utilize a repulsive force,
while grav plates generally use an attractive force.  In all
three devices, the "effects" being manipulated are gravitic.

Inertial compensators, on the other hand, intercept inertial
"effects" and use feedback techniques to reduce or nullify
inertia on selected bodies.  Looked at this way, we can see
that inertial compensators are not *truly* gravitic devices,
but that the technology is similar enough so that we need
make no distinction, except in the scientific community.

For the remainder of this article, I  use "gravitic devices"
to refer to inertial devices as well.  I do not use the term
to apply to jump drives, even though they have many features
in common with gravitic devices.

- --------------------------

Basic Design of Gravitic Devices:

Gravitic devices operate much like valves in a water hose.  A
small change in the characteristics of the device (valve)
produces a large change in output (flow).  That is to say that
the energy you feed your drives (from the power plant) is not
converted to thrust.  It is used to control and direct the
flow of "effect" from an interaction that occurs in hyperspace.

All gravitic devices have the same general design.  A typical
device has a "concentrator", a "plate", and a "governor".



- ------------------------------
|Conc. ||        || Output   |
|Plate |--------| Gov.   |------| Plate    |
|      ||        |      |   |
- ------------|-----      ------------
\    |          /
 \----------    /
  \_____| Comp. |---/
- ----------

The concentrator plate is basically a hyperspace receive antenna.
It collects and concentrates wade-ranging "effects" into a small
region of space-time.  The concentrator does not create hyper-
space interactions; that would take too much energy.  It does tap
directly into activity in hyperspace and intercept the
interactions already there.

The output (or thruster) plate is basically a space-time output
antenna.  It directs and releases the concentrated "effects"
gathered by the concentrator.  Examine drive plates for a
classic example.  (Refer to the "Starship Operator's Manual,
vol. 1, pages 2-4.)  Notice how the output is strong in the
plate's basic direction, but weakens sharply in other directions.
Notice also that all plates are invariably placed so that
*nothing* gets within about a meter of them.  We'll discuss
this more in a minute.

The governor is the part of the device that monitors and
controls the concentrator and the plate.  It matches input,
output, and demand (from the ship's computer).  Needless to
say, this is where most of the technology, and most of the
problems occur.


- ----------------------------

Limits of Gravitic Devices:

There is a serious side effect to using a gravitic device
because the device operates both in hyperspace and in
space-time.  Using a gravitic device "warps" space-time
around the concentrator.  This warping is very like the
warping of space-time around black holes, only the radius
of curvature of space is much shorter, usually measured
in meters rather than kilometers.  This warping becomes
more intense as the acceleration produced by the device
increases.  Beyond about 60 m/s/s acceleration (6 g) (4),
the device becomes inoperable because of relativistic
effects (5).

The warping of space-time caused by gravitic devices is
identical to the warping to space-time by a gravity field,
only intense and of short range.  It is critical, especially
in jump-capable vessels to have space-time as smooth as
possible in and around the ship.  The amount space-time is
warped represents how much is not known about the ship's
present position, or its destination.  Hence -- misjumps.

If these "warps" caused by using gravitics are left
unaltered, time would flow at different rates in different
parts of the ship, sensors would not operate properly,
thrusters would fight themselves, and jumps (if possible)
would be wholly unpredictable.

The plates associated with all gravitic devices are large
(and in the case of drives, massive) mainly to deal with this
warping of space-time.  The plates function as antennae that
receive hyperspacial energy and broadcast "spacial" energy.
They could be microscopic and do this.

However, the plates also "sink" or dissipate the space-time
warping associated with the use of the gravitic device.  For
this task the plates need to be large, to "spread out" the
effects of the warping of space-time.

In the case of jump-capable ships, even this is not enough.
For a few microseconds before a jump, all gravitic devices on
starships are switched completely off.  The transition to
jumpspace is made, and gravitics are switched back on.  This
enables the computers to more properly enable the jump vector,
eases the load on the power plant during its most critical
mission, and allows the gravitic devices to switch to the
different circuits they need to operate from within jumpspace.

It is probably this short hiatus in gravity that causes the
momentary disorientation and nausea felt by even experienced
space hands at the moment of transition.

- ---------------------------------

Effects of Gravity on Maneuvering Vessels:

Gravity has little effect on most vessels unless that vessel has
lost its maneuver drives or is near a large celestial body (one
large enough to orbit - or perhaps a runaway maneuver drive?).
Thrust from maneuver drives so overwhelms most gravitational
forces in deep space so as to make them inconsequential.

Near large bodies, though, gravity causes us to radically alter
our flight paths and operational methods.  The force of gravity
decreases as the distance from the attracting body increases (6).
In many instances, this force can be greater that what we can deliver
with thrusters; we must orbit the body.

This also means that for a ship in orbit, for instance, the
"bottom" of the ship (closest to the planet) and its occupants
have more gravity on them than the top of the ship and its
occupants do.  This phenomenon is called microgravity, and it is
used to stabilize satellites in almost every spacefaring culture.




Satellite Top ------------Gravity - a little
||
||
Center of Mass ---|   *|Gravity at orbit
||
||
Satellite Bottom ------------Gravity + a little



Ordinarily, microgravity is no problem.  However, in close orbits
of very large bodies, stresses can build up in a ship's hull both
from the gradient of microgravity and from the relativistic
stresses caused by the sheer speed of the vessel.

The main problems from gravity are long-term.  On-board gravitic
devices, interacting with gravitational forces, cause stress on the
ship's frame and hull.  This stress is normally minor, but can be
severe close to large bodies, especially if the vessel is
maneuvering.  In deep space, away from gravity wells, a ship's
gravitic devices are tuned to minimize stresses on the vessel.

- ------------------------------------

Effects of Inertia on Maneuvering Vessels:

Inertia is a much more severe problem for maneuvering.  It is easy
to imagine maneuvers that could quickly make almost any sapient
creature strictly two-dimensional.  Additionally, rapid changes
in speed and direction cause enormous stress on the ship's frame.
We are most familiar with inertia as a force that tends to pull us
toward the outside of turns or pushed back in our seats when we
accelerate.  The magnitude of the force we feel depends only on
how fast we are changing our speed or direction.

In a space vessel these inertial forces are almost always enormous
because the ship is travelling very, very fast.  For instance,
making a 5-g (2) 180-degree circular turn at just over Terran escape
velocity (a veritable snail's pace in space) creates a circular
path over 10,000 km long, and a corresponding flight time of over
13 minutes to execute the maneuver (7).

Incidently, it would also take 13 minutes to reverse course by
rotating the ship 180 degress (it's now flying backwards) and
apply a continuous 5-g thrust.  No one can turn around quickly
enough to surprise and overtake his pursuers.

High agility doesn't provide this ability either.  Agility is
simply a measure of a ship's ability to change *facing*, not
to change it's speed and/or direction.  That is, agility is a
figure expressing a vessel's ability to pitch, roll, or yaw.
"Maneuverability" is a figure that expresses, in g-forces, the
maximum linear acceleration a space vessel is capable of.
"Normally" (who knows what those TL 21 miscreants are up to!?)
this is a figure from 1 to 6 (10 to 60 m/s/s).

This means that space battles are inherently linear.  Much like
the days of sailing, with ships in a line.  Only in space, guns
can be aimed (turned away from the beam of the ship) and it is
possible to sail (fly) over and under, as well as around (or into)
your opponents.  (Ships in a plane?) I guess there is a good
reason to teach formation flying!

- ----------------------------

Inertial compensators:

My first thought on seeing their availability was that this was
the way out of the inertia trap just presented.  "I could build
a ship with maneuver 12 and inertia dampers 6, exposing the
maneuver drives to only 6-g acceleration," I thought.  It doesn't
work that way though.

The maneuver drives, and the inertial compensators work on effects
of hyperspatial interactions.  Their use causes space-time to warp.
Remember that it is acceleration, not force, that determines the
extent of warping of space-time within and around the ship.  Because
of this, gravitic devices (like maneuver drives) can be of any size.
They cannot however, produce more than 6-g of acceleration.  Period.

Inertial compensators don't do anything for the space-time warping
caused by the maneuver drives.  In fact, they make it worse.  As the
maneuver drive creates more acceleration, space-time warps more, and
more strongly.  Inertial compensators counter-warp space-time locally,
and in so doing exacerbate the overall effect.  Your ship's computers
must be bigger and faster to handle the load, and you suck up even
more fuel.

What this means is that you cannot design a ship with a maneuver 12
and agility 12 and inertial compensators 6.  It would be nice if you
could, but those big massive driveplate antennas would wipe out all
of your available volume and then some.  The best you can hope for
with inertial compensation is to provide a feeling of "motionlessness"
for your crew and passengers.

- -----------------------------------

Repulsers and Grav Plates:

These are basically straightforward maneuver drives, adapted for
special uses.  Grav plates primarily hold things down, and
repulsers hold things away.

Grav plates are tied in with the inertial compensator circuitry.
Grav plates need to be large in area, but light and small in
cross section.  They are used throughout the ship, and produce
from -6 to +5 g (if your maneuver drive is that good - if it
isn't, buy cheaper inertia systems) to compensate for the ship's
maneuvering.  Notice that the plates can produce one less g in
the "down" direction (letting inertial hold you to the deck),
but that on "outside" turns, you will sometimes experience free
fall.  That's just as much force as we can produce.
(The rules say so.)

Additionally, grav plates need to produce an exceptionally
uniform field.  Studies as early as TL 7 terra (really!) showed
that if your perception of "down" changes often or radically,
you *will* get at least nauseated.  This is commonly known as
sea- or air-sickness.  It is especially acute when the victim
lacks outside reference and/or feels confined (like in a space
ship).

Repulsers are high energy, high curvature, effect projectors.
That is, they are maneuver drives with small area, high mass
plates.  This produces a "beam" of gravitational energy, almost
always away from the projector.

"Reversing" the field effect (to make a tractor beam) usually
causes more damage to the ship trying it than to the ship in
tow.  In my campaign, I allow limited use of "tractors" for
in-system towing around TL 16.

- ----------------------------

Maneuver Drives

Maneuver drive plates are usually mounted across the aft end
of a starship.  In this configuration, they can provide the
most force in the most desired direction.


Region of Low Force

High Force| |<-plates--------    Region of *really*
| |             --------    Low Force

- -

 Region of Low Force

Since the plates also deliver force to the sides, a ship can "hover"
horizontally if the gravity is not too high.  This is how air rafts
work.  Space ships eventually rotate into a more conventional
attitude to leave the atmosphere of a planet.  (See the "Starship
Operator's Manual, vol. 1, page 3.)

The plates of the maneuver drive must be extremely large, to
"linearize" the fields around the whole ship, and must be massive
so that a great deal of energy can be pumped through them.  Look
at the information about the mass and volume of the drives (in the
Referee's manual, page 65) based on ship's mass and maneuver
number.  Notice that mass and volume increase linearly with ship's
mass, and exponentially with acceleration.

Maneuver drives take the most power of any ship's system.  (Well,
a jump drive takes a lot, too, but it's antenna is the entire
ship's hull.)  This is because of the sheer quantity of energy
being converted.

When in use, maneuver drives leave tell-tale perturbations in
space-time.  Sophisticated sensors can detect the slight
perturbations in stellar signatures that indicate the passage
of a ship, and it's course.

- -----------------------------

Summary

Gravitics in the service of humaniti.  By TL 10, gravitics
are as ubiquitous as computers.  Every air raft, every ATV
(or AFV), every air craft, space craft, and starship use
gravitics for propulsion.  Gravitics are great for hauling
and lifting heavy loads, and for medical assistance to the
invalid.  And it all came about because spewing chemicals
into space is much too expensive a way to get anywhere.



- -------------------------------------------------------
Notes:

1.This equivalence courtesy A. Einstein.
E=mC^2
says, mathematically, that mass (inertia) and
energy are *equivalent* modified by a known
constant (the speed of light, C).


2.This calculation arrived a little later than
Einstein's.  Planck gave us E=hu with h being
a physical constant, and u being the frequency
of the wave being measured.

But, frequency is (velocity/wavelength), so for
electromagnetic waves, E = hC/l with l being the
wavelength and C the speed of light.

For typical masses (grams - kilograms - tons),
a typical wavelength for the energy composing
the matter is ~10^24 meters.  This is roughly
as many times smaller than an atom as an atom
is smaller than us.

Energy densities this high *cannot* exist in
normal space-time.  We can only speculate at
how they might actually interrelate in dimensions
we can't measure.  High-energy supercolliders
are attempts to release enough energy in a
short period of time to hopefully catch some of
the affects of these interactions "in the act".


3.This is where I actually begin "honest" Mega-
Traveller speculation about what it all means.


4.A "g" is defined as the acceleration due to
gravity at mean sea level on Terra
(Solomani Rim/Sol 1827 A867A69-F).  This is
roughly 9.8 m/s/s.


5.Relativistic effects include time slowing down
(literally!) in some parts of the ship, disa-
greement at a molecular level what the length
and density of ship's (or crew's) members should
be, and so forth.  In general, "relativistic
effects" means we become totally uncertain about
everything; we can't "know" anything without
altering the conditions upon which we "know" it.


6.Actually, gravity decreases with the square of the
distance.  Newton's formula F=G(m*M/r^2) gives the
exact description of the force of attraction between
any two bodies, m and M at a distance r from each
other.

This rapid fall off in the potential for hyperspace
interaction is serendipitous.  Imagine the trouble
at Capital if the Solomani figured out they could
cause space-time warping remotely because the
interactions they tap into in hyperspace reach that
far...


7.To compute the length of the path, we first determine
the radius of the circle (r) followed by the ship,
using the general formula for centripetal acceleration
(a = v^2/r).  We assign a to 50 m/s/s (about 5-g) and
v to our ship's speed (13 km/s - roughly escape velocity).
Then:

r = v^2 / a
r = 13 km/s * 13 km/s / 0.05 km/s
r = 3380 km

Next, we use the formula for the circumference of a
circle to determine the length of the path travelled.
We cut our determined value in half because we only
travel half the circle.

d = 2 * pi * r
d = 0.5 (2 * 3.14159 * 3380)
d = 10 618 km

To determine the time it takes to travel this far,
we use the formula

t = d / v
t = 10 618 km / 13 km/s
t = 817 s

If we  divide by 60 to get minutes, we arrive at
13.61 minutes to execute that U-turn.

Is it just me, or does everyone else actually like the Digest Group task
system that is used for MegaTravller and 2300AD (Which I actually like.
Anyone else out there actually play it?)?

I find the 4-point thresholds simply ludicrous, the stat add thresholds
(every 5!) silly as well, and while many aspects are covered, there sure
is a lot of dice rolling (and as far as I can tell, there are provisions
for critical failures but not critical successes).

I myself simply cannot stomach it (and consequently have been trying to
devise a replacement, with mixed success...), and I'm just curious if
there is something I am missing, or is this truly the state of the art?

  (waving hand) ME!  ME!

|(every 5!) silly as well, and while many aspects are covered, there sure
|is a lot of dice rolling (and as far as I can tell, there are provisions
|for critical failures but not critical successes).

  I use a slightly modified task system in 2300AD (don't play MT).  My task
  levels use steps of 2 (I.E. Trivial=1, Simple=3, Easy=5, Routine=7,
  Challenging=9, Difficult=11, Hard=13, Formidable=15, Overwelming=17,
  Unreasonable=19, Near Impossible=21, Impossible=22) and I have shifted
  skill rolls to using 2d6 instead of 1d10 (the curve makes the difference
  between difficulties more reasonable).  I'm trying to figure out how to
  fit the hit locations table to 2d6 so I can dispense with d10's completely.

  Another change I made, mainly to the Melee Combat system, the the ability to
  choose your maneuvers.  Instead of striking at Routine all the time, you may
  choose to do a "Hard" strike, requiring a "Overwelming" block.  This allows
  those trained in the martial arts to perform those hard-to-stop strikes on
  the lesser trained.  A side note to this rule is that if you choose a more
  difficult strike, and you fail the skill roll, you are considered
  "off-balance" and your next block is made at one level (2 point level)
  increased difficulty.  As a ref you can handle this system two ways:

     1) Descriptive: "I do a high snap kick to his head!"  "Ok, that's a
        Difficult Strike"
     2) Specific: "I do a Challenging Punch"

  The first method adds more color to the game as the players come up with
  flashy kicks and punches, but forces the referee to make judgement calls
  on the actual difficulties.  The second is quicker, but pretty dry.

  I also use a slightly shifted attribute modifier chart.  It goes something
  like this:

    Level Mod       Level Mod        Level Mod        Level Mod
       1   -6          7   -1          13    0          19   +2
       2   -5          8   -1          14   +1          20   +3
       3   -4          9   -1          15   +1          21   +3
       4   -3         10    0          16   +1          22   +3
       5   -2         11    0          17   +2          23   +4
       6   -2         12    0          18   +2          24   +4

  Example:  Joe Scout is walking though the woods, making geographic notes when
  he suddenly spots a Kafer mob heading toward his position.  Since running
  would alert them to his presence, he decides to hit the bushes and hide.
  There is no "Hiding" skill -- it's simply a matter of choosing the right
  place and being quiet.  Joe is reasonably Intelligent (14) and has a skill of
  2 in Survival.  He must make an Uncertain task roll to find the right cover.
  The ref decides that given the fact he can't move very far, but given the
  amount of cover available, it is a Routine task.  Joe get to add 2 for his
  skill and +1 for his intelligence for a 4+ for success.  If both he and the
  referee roll 4+, he's well hidden from simply being seen.  If either Joe or
  the ref fail their roll, he's hidden, but could be spotted (his butt's
  sticking out or something.  If both fail, this turkey is trying to hide
  behind a sapling.  If Joe did not have a skill in survival, He would have to
  make a challenging task roll, adding ONLY his intelligence modifier.

|I myself simply cannot stomach it (and consequently have been trying to

  The Task system is okay, you just have to tweak it a bit here and there.
  Once a few changes are made it works fine.

Well, since I think it's absolutely the greatest thing since sliced toast,
I suppose the answer to that question would be yes.

You must be playing with the old Digest Group version of the rules (published
in GRAND SURVEY, GRAND CENSUS, and TRAVELLER: 2300), which makes you make a
"failure roll" whenever you fail.  The new version of the task system, which
appears in MEGATRAVELLER (and, presumably, 2300 AD, although I haven't seen
the new edition), eliminates half the die rolling by replacing the failure
roll with rules for exceptional success and exceptional failure.  (This also
addresses the other gripe you had.)

In the new system, whenever you succeed by more than 2, it's an exceptional
success.  When you fail by more than 2, it's an exceptional failure.  (I
say "more than 2," but it's really 2+, which I feel is too small a margin).
A natural 2 is still always a fumble.  Exceptional failure on a hazardous
task or ordinary failure on a fateful task results in a 2D mishap.  Fumbling
a hazardous task, or getting exceptional failure on a task that is both
hazardous AND fateful, results in a 3D mishap.  The rules don't say this
either, but I suppose that you could make a case for rolling four dice on
the mishap table if you fumble a haz/fate task....

As for the 4-point separation between difficulty levels, I frequently find
myself applying arbitrary -1, +1, or +2 modifiers to some tasks as a means
of "fine-tuning" them in specific cases.  These modifiers get added in on
an ad hoc basis for specific cases of tasks and don't go in my task library
(except in unusual cases...).  They let me fine-tune the difficulty of
individual attempts to get the right balance.  But I wouldn't publish them
in an adventure or supplement -- the levels they give are supposed to be
general guidelines, not straitjackets.  They work well for me, at least.  A
typical pilot, for example, with a Dex of 7 and a Pilot skill of 2, making a
Routine, Pilot, Dex check will succeed on a 4+... whereas someone with no
skill needs a 10 or better.  Seems about right to me.

As for the 5-point characteristic bonuses, I like the way they balance out
too as they give characters with superior abilities an edge, but not so much
that they dominate the game.  Remember -- this is Traveller, not AD&D.  The
power curve between strong and weak characters is supposed to be MUCH flatter.
As it stands, you get a +1 on attempts if you have an ability of 10+, and a
- - -1 if you have an ability of 4-, as compared to the average Joe.  In the

I'm finding I have a hard time stomaching anything else any more.  I seem
to be having the opposite experience you are with this... instead of causing
a lot of die rolling, the task system I've been using eliminates most of the
die rolling I've had to do (except in cases of fumbles).  Unless the players
are worried about time or a mishap occurs, every task rides on a single die
roll, which can be very rapidly calculated.

The whole idea behind the task system is that you should be able to easily
memorize it, and apply it without really worrying about mechanics.  The system
lets me take my hands off the mechanics and worry about creating a challenging
adventure and realistic settings and NPC's and not the rules of running the
game.  And the sorts of things the system lets you do replace several pages of
new rules for each new task.  I love it.  Star Wars does something similar
with its standard difficulty levels and equally simple mechanics.

My one gripe about MegaTraveller is its damage system.  PC's can take too
much punishment from guns, not enough from melee weapons.  I get around this
by dividing each damage value for a weapon by 3 (retaining fractions) and
applying it as 2300-style damage.

Yes, you are missing something.  First off there are critical successes:
In combat, if you have a powerful enough weapon, you can make an instant kill.
The four point thresholds are decent and in my campaign they work.  As for
the stat add thresholds of every five, yeah, they are crap.  What I do is
modify the modifier by substracting two or three (I am just trying it recently).
This way if you have very low stats it hurts you, which seems a little more
realistic.  I do like the task system, because it makes for a consistent system
for determining whether you have accomplished something.  It allows for better
roleplaying because it gives the players a better idea of what the likelihood
of accomplishing a task would be. (I would give an examle, but right now I
am in a hurry.)

As for 2300AD... Do I like it? Well, yes. I have a 2300AD campaign which is
over a year old going very well right now.

Subject: Space Habitats (was Re: Gravitics...)


	I think Space Habitats can be used very nicely for a campaign setting
(although at the moment I'm biased, having just finished _Vacuum_Flowers_).
I also think that they will rarely show up in traveller campaigns.  Personally,
I think the Imperium is too friggin' big!  The GM should pick a nice-sized
chunk and flesh it out a lot (detail on each world, sprinkle a few space
habitats and curiosities around, etc).  Back to the subject...

	Two good books for Space Habitat background:  Christopher Rowley's
_Starhammer_ and Michael Swanwick's _Vacuum_Flowers_.  The latter is cyber-
punk, and has space habitats ranging from orbiting cans to dyson worlds to
cometary settlments.  It's a good book which I highly reccomend for reading for
personal pleasure, and it could serve as a nice little unusual but highly
fleshed out system for Traveller (hmm... that's an idea, take fifty or a
hundred of your favorite SF books and "place" them in a chunk of imperial
space, either carefully subsituting for near matches or merely putting them
where you like...).

	The problem with Vacuum Flowers is that it is cyberpunk, and much of
the material of the world therein might not match your traveller campaign,
especially the wetware (computer-brain enhancements) and the apparent dichotomy
of technology (wetware, but their space travel is pretty weak, and interstellar
travel non-existent).  You might get around this by making the citizens very
humanoid aliens (but their brain structure is different enough to allow them to
easily use wetware, while normal humans cannot) or by making the fancy tech
VERY dependent upon the rest of the society's technology (either because it is
not compatible with tech from other systems, or because it reli

Hi gang,

I was mulling over the idea of warm up times for starship power plants and I
came to the following thoughts:

Warm up time is going to be highly dependant on the size, age, and maintenance
record of the power plant in question.  Larger, older, and less maintained
power plants are going to take longer to come on line than a smaller, newer,
well maintained power plant.

I think of my 77 Plymouth Volare station wagon.  It has a "slant 6" engine in
it, a medium size, very reliable motor.  Because it is old and its previous
owner didn't take very good care of it, it tends to be a little
cantankerous in the morning.   A freind of mine has a souped up Chevy (size of
motor unknown, just very souped!) and because it is a complex beasty it
doesn't want to start on any but the nicest day and it complains at that!

What is my point?  I am just trying to say that you really can't have a hard
fast set of rules about starships run up times.   I think a great deal of
flexibility has to be applied to the question.

Subject: Taxes


A while ago, I asked a friend of mine, who knows a lot more about
economics than I do, and is also an avid Traveller player to help me
come up with a way the interstellar taxation system works.
This is how I/we work it.
	1) The imperium takes a slice from the military spending of
		all member planets to help pay for the navy etc.
	2) Most if not all planets have their own internal taxation
		(income taxes/property taxes etc.)
	3) The Imperium prohibits import duties on all member planets
		except for small income tarrifs, which are
		discouraged.
	4) The imperium imposes a value-added tax on all manufacturing
		on Hi-Pop worlds.

Mostly we find that your average wandering free trader does not have
to pay too much in the way of taxes, as 1 and 4 don't apply to them at
all, and they rearely have to pay income taxes at home and the tarrifs
can be assumed to be built into the price system.  There are always
exceptions. "What do you mean I owe seven years back income tax I
haven't been here in seven years.  Oh yeah, you gave me citizenship
didn't you?"

Subject: Black holes


This subject came up (Actually I brought it up :-)) on the star system
generation group, and I was wondering about everone's opinion on this:

What does everyone assume about stellar phenomenon? There has never been a
place for generating black holes, neutron stars, nebula, dust clouds,
pulsars etc. in the rules.

I have always assumed that there were a lot more stars than are actually drawn
on the map. The other "unmapped" stars would only be of passing interest to
Scientists (1 month research trips and unmanned montioring probes). All of
these "stars" would have two things in common:
a) no fuel to speak of (interstellar hydrogen, occasionaly a comet or two)
b) no solid surfaces to put bases or other strucures on.

Therefore they are not placed on the maps as jumpspace effectively ignores
everything between the entry/exit points (The navigator worries about
them and their possible influence but not anyone else).

I seem to recall some rules (Leviathin/Zhodani module? I'm going to have to
bring my rules into work...) That seemed to make it extraordinarily difficult
to map the area that you are in. I believe that even with today's
technology, we could map the majority of the imperium without leaving earth
(albeit only star locations).
This inconsistancy (as I see it) could be accounted for if there was other
stellar objects that are not of interest.

Here is something that I occured to me on this great discussion about trying
to get bast the 6-G barrior.  What ever happened to the good old fashoned
ROCKET!!.  They aren't bothered by any warping in the time/space/whatever
fields.  They just shoot and shoot.  I would be intersted to see if someone
can come up with a viable versions.  They would obviously be limmeted to
ships about 600t and smaller simply because they would take up so much room.
Admittedly their main disadvantage would be size.  But they have two advantages
and that is:a) alows you to use a manuever 6 plus the rockets to get that total
of manuever 12.  b) cost.  They would still be cheaper per manuever then a
manuever drive.  Though another disadvantage is a wpn hitting the O2 tanks.
plus they couldn't be fully refueled at a gass giant. Minor things, but when
you need that extra burst of speed in the middle of combat.

Another minor problem is getting the inerial compensators to work for those high
G's.  but then again modern fighter pilots regularly are under sustained 5-6G
manuevers.  Then bring in the 6G compensators would bring the 12G acceleration
to a simple 6G felling for the crew and passengers.

Yea I know some of this doesn't make sense, but when you right on the fly, not
everything can work out perfectly.

Well, the simplest method is as follows.

Grav-plates utilise gravity-type forces to overcome the 'real' gravity
produced by a planet, and to provide thrust. Repulsors use similar forces
to keep enemy missiles away. What's their theory of operation? I don't know,
go and ask a gravitics scientist!

After all, how many computer users could give you a detailed account of just
how little lumps of silicon deliberately made impure to create junctions
can do what computers do? Do many jet fighter pilots have any knowledge of
the chemistry of jet fuel? Do many starship pilots really know the inside
story of their manoeuvre drives?

If the PC's want to make life difficult for the referee by going and asking a
gravitic scientist, then the scientist (after giving them an appointment -
he's got more important things to do, after all) gives them a nice long lecture
involving enough 3rd order differential equations to make them sick of
gravitics for the rest of their lives.

Almost all SF has some kind of sufficiently advanced technology to make the
story interesting - in Traveller, it's gravitics, nuclear dampers and jump
drives. It isn't really necessary to come up with long explanations of how it
all works. As far as the PC is concerned, all that is important is that it
does work, or that he/she can apply a suitable skill to repair it if it
doesn't.

Or, if you must invent long explanations for everything in order for it to
be plausible for you, then you'll have to also write long essays on just
what is involved in such skills as Starship Tactics, Demolition, Admin, and
all the rest. And no cheating by saying "Well, such things are understood,
but I'm not an expert".

I'm not sure what you mean by all this, but I think you may
be confusing space-time distortion with Heisenberg
uncertainty.  The former is a relativistic effect, and the
latter a quantum mechanical one.

One of the beautiful features of Einstein's formulation of
special and general relativity is that the effects of
space-time distortion are deterministic, in the same sense
that classical mechanics is deterministic:  If you have
complete information about the state of a system at time T,
you can perfectly calculate its state at all future times
T+t.  (Note that the notion of time here *is* a little
confusing -- suffice it to say that any relativistic system
is completely causal, i.e. time flows forward only, and that
it is always possible to synchronize all the "local clocks"
to any causal "master clock", which you can then think of as
"the" clock...)  Indeed, for any reasonably advanced society,
the calculations shouldn't be much more difficult.

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is a fundamental feature
of quantum mechanics.  Quantum mechanics, unlike relativity,
is a completely non-deterministic theory:  Even if you could
have complete information about the state of a system at time
T, you could only calculate the *probability* of the system
being in some other specified state at time T+t.  (In fact,
for *any* state, the probability of the system moving to that
state is nonzero -- just so low that it will "never" happen
in the expected lifetime of this universe!).  But
Heisenberg's principle says that you can't ever even
*acquire* complete information about the state of a QM
system.  In particular, let the probability that a particle
has a given velocity be P(v), and the probability that it has
a given position be P(x).  Then P(x)P(v) <= C, where C is a
magic constant.  Thus, the more certain you are about *where*
a particle is, the less certain you are about where it's
going, and vice-versa.

Thus, the above-quoted statements probably should invoke QM,
or even QCD, the merger of QM with relativistics.  However,
this opens up a whole 'nother nasty can of worms for the
gravitics theorist...

Comments or criticisms, anyone?  I'm sure there's some real
howler lurking in my comments somewhere... :-)

There is some interesting information about taxes in Trillion Credit
Squardon. There is a section on incomes from planets for a campaign game.
If I remember correctly the revenue was 500 Cr per person modified by
government and state of hostilites. This represents just the naval budget.
(Hence the importance of high population worlds to the factions in the
imperium. I have always presumed that this naval budget is split between
the local, Subsector and imperial navys. In this case the imperium gets
money for its fleet in return for protecting the planet (The only thing
the Imperium seems to do for local planets). This implies that the imperium
gets its cut from the locals, but doesn't care how they come up with it in the
first place. In this case the planetary government can call on Imperial/Subsector
forces to help retrieve tax money from citizens or visitors who are reluctant to
pay.
At 500 Cr per person just for the military (navy), the average family of four
pays 2000Cr per year, then we add in local taxes for the government, which vary
but I usualy use 4x this amount. Resulting in a net Cr8,000 per year. (If I
remember correctly some crew members only make Cr1,000 a month. - They better not
have large families!)
To answer your questions directly. The imperial portion would be the same,
across the imperium, (but the locals may not collect it equally). Taxes are
collected according to the government type of the planet in question.
Deviousness doesn't have to come into it. If you don't pay duty etc. no trading
impounding of ship/cargo, etc. (This does bring into question who the full-time
starship crews pay their taxes to?)

If you are dealing at a starport, the imperial reguations regarding
trade would be used (another service provided to the planet!) And a standard
mechanism for payment of taxes, calcualting weights (eg. Imperial Litre :-)),
and paperwork. If you are dealing outside of the starport, you had better have
a good legal skill. (A good incentive to always use the port facilities, even
if there is a slight charge...)

			-Dan Corrin

By the way. If you calculate the income from the high population worlds, in the
Imperium, a fleet of 11000 BatRons can be easily maintained.

I remember checking some of this out once. The Traveller rules have stars
spaced approximately correctly. (Ie ave seperation in the range of a parsec
or two).

The problem is that the distribution of stellar types is such that the vast
majority of star are class M dwarfs. These require space based observatories
to locate if they are even a sector away!

At least it is fairly simple to determine stellar positions given a medium
sized (say 20 inch?) scope on a jump capable ship. Do a full 360 degree
photo survey. Do a Jump-1. Take a second set of photos. Run them thru the
computers to see which images moved and how much. Plot the positions.
Continue.

Black holes and neutron stars require a supernova to form. These require rather
large (and thankfully rare!) stars. I've seen estimates that place the lethal
radiation zone around a supernova at 15-30 parsecs. So a supernova would *kill*
a sector in all directions! The effects include what amounts to a massive
EMP. So unless your whole planet is using Fiber backup electronics...

We do have a small nebula down in the Aslan area. Except for the small
nebula ("planetary" nebulas) they tend to be sub-sector to sector size. It's
not surprising that there are so few in the mapped areas.

An old neutron star or a "brown dwarf" would have interesting possiblities.
A brown dwarf might be able to keep a small *very* close in planet warm enough
to be habitable. And it would be dim enough that it might not have been mapped.
This would make a great adventure....

Yes, but the average seperation is also in 3D space, so we are losing a number
of stars for our 2D representation. There can be many excuses for this
simplification, but as I mentioned, I assume that these other stars are not
interesting, and (for a simple model) vertical movement is unnecessary.

The charts for star creation do not give this distribution, and a viewing a
sector at a time is good data collection, unlike the core exploration rules
in the Zhodani module.

The supernova doesn't bother us if it occured 500 Million years ago, there is
no data on the density of black holes as they are so difficult to detect, there
could be ones lingering arond from the big bang (assuming you subscribe to
that theory). There could be a blackhole/neturon star in every sector, or even
every subsector without any having been formed since the time of the Ancients.

Your last point was very good...i think I'll use it in my next campaign...

Subject: on "invisible" star systems



A nuclear astrophysicist's view of Dan Corrin's query:

>From a Traveller standpoint, all of the unusual stellar phenomena about which
he's wondered are utterly unimportant. Why? Two reasons: scales of stellar
population, and the distribution and density of unusual star types.

The population distribution of stars with respect to size, age, and light/heat
output (i.e. luminosity) is a well-understood function, essentially an
exponential "pyramid" with the brightest stars at the top and the dimmest at
the bottom. For every fairly bright star such as Sirius, there are hundreds
and hundreds of dim red or brown dwarfs like Barnard's Star; for every very
bright star like Acrux, there are hundreds of Siriuses. The problem with the
current star system generation tables is that if they reflected the true
population distribution of stars in the primary galactic medium, they'd bore
the average gamer to tears, because on a 3D6 table you'd need to roll a 3 or
an 18 to get anything other than a red dwarf, and then you'd have to roll a 3
or an 18 to get anything in spectral class any higher than F, and so on. From
the point of view of a "pointillistic" star system setup like Traveller or
2300 (i.e., we can only go so far before our engines poop out, so every star
system becomes an important stepping stone), the universe becomes an
intricately detailed and dishwater-dull place. |-> [In all fairness, a
"wide-dispersion" game like Space Opera (i.e., our drives have infinite speed
and range so we can pick and choose which worlds we settle) tends to lean
heavily on bizarre systems and unlikely planetary groups; hence the
Space-Opera nature of the game, where if there's no air to breathe normally
outside your Laser-Blazer stellar interceptor craft when you crashland on
Xymox IV, it MUST be a plot device.] In other words, it's unreasonable to ask
Traveller for a "more realistic" star system population distribution; if it
got any more realistic we'd die of boredom, and as it is its departures from
reality are vital if we're to have more than a fistful of inhabitable worlds
in the 11000 star systems of the Imperium.

The fallacy in Dan's argument is as follows: Why shouldn't it be possible to
see everything we need to chart, he asks, considering the fact that we can see
so much just from Earth with today's telescopes? The fact is, we really can't
see very much at all! Our vision relies on apparent luminosity, a quantity
which is heavily dependent on temperature and proximity in a synergistic
fashion. What this means is that while we see a mixture of red, orange,
yellow, white, and blue-white stars in our sky, they by no means reflect true
stellar populations: nearly half of the red dwarfs that we know of can be fit
on the Traveller:2300 Near Star Map with its 50-light-year radius, and the
bright star Deneb in Cygnus, 1600 miles distant, is used as an example of a
one-of-a-kind bright star in a stellar population not only by us, but by the
Vilani as they ply the routes of the First Imperium not far from where we sit,
by the Aslan as they make their first tentative steps toward the Tlaukhu, by
the Vargr as they howl their unanswered questions to the moons of Lair, and to
the Droyne as they look up from their mud huts and beg Yaskoydray to come
back. As a bright star, Deneb stands alone; the star charts of the Imperium
reflect this. The Solomani Rim chart features many stars of lesser but still
bright magnitude; that's because we know they exist. In the neighborhood of
Terra there are three dozen tiny red stars that we can see; if we extrapolate
this to the rest of the galaxy, we assume that each yellow star is surrounded
by red ones, and each yellow-star community is part of a cluster that
surrounds a white star, and so on.

The Near Star Map, by the way, is lifted from an excellent reference on this
sort of thing, the Gliese Catalogue of Near Stars, including the Van
Biesbroeck catalogue, the Ross and Wolf star lists, the American Catalogue,
and the little-known but very worthwhile Vyssotsky listing of red stars, which
cites a lot of bizarre little details about some of our nearest neighbors; the
true interest in the piddling dwarfs in our back yard comes not from their
size and heat but from their odd behavior. Many are actually multiple star
systems, with companions too small to see; others are variables that flare up
from time to time in bursts of killing heat. There's a lot of interest here,
but one has to dig for it.

And what about nebulae, neutron stars, and black holes? Forget them. They're
so rare and distantly spaced, and so noisy by their presence, that in the era
of Traveller we'd probably know about many times as many of them as we do
now, but the new ones we'd have found would all be even further away from us
than the ones we know now. There are fewer than a hundred pulsars in our sky,
and none of them is closer than the Crab, which is (I think; let me look it
up) beyond the range of the Imperium's survey maps. The three X-ray sources
believed to be black holes, Cygnus X-1 and X-3 and Scorpius X-1, are even
further distant, their companions blue supergiants that dwarf even Deneb. It's
just not feasible to try to generate them randomly; they'd never come up in a
local area like ours. (There is the possibility of localized dark matter, like
brown dwarfs and black holes without companions, but the former would barely
perturb a jump route unless they happened to move through EXACTLY the path of
a jumping ship, which is ridiculously unlikely, and the latter don't make much
sense from a cosmological standpoint.)

It's my opinion that the star system generators should stick to areas where
any number of guesses might be perfectly okay, as in planetary groupings; we
only have one system on which to base our guesses as of now, and it'll be a
couple of centuries before we get out to Agidda and learn differently from the
Vilani. In terms of creating stellar groupings, it's unreasonable to have more
than a miniscule chance of anything more unusual than a single or multiple
main-sequence star group. Giants, maybe once in a great while; Supergiants,
almost never; Black holes, no way.

I hope this clears up the question; if not, then I've bored an AWFUL lot of
people. I'll be glad to argue this point with anyone who thinks I'm wrong from
a standpoint of realism, but have your references ready: I have mine. As for a
game-fun standpoint, I believe in doing what needs to be done, of course, but
there are a lot of ways to spice up a new sector than to sprinkle Wolf-Rayet
and RR Lyrae stars everywhere just to freak out navigators....

Subject: Cold Iron starts
Date: Sun Oct 15 19:15:21 1989
From: richard@agora.hf.intel.COM (Richard Johnson)


When I was in the Coast Guard, we had three general readiness levels,
called "alpha", "bravo", and "charlie".  Within each readiness level
was a number identifying time before we could actually leave the pier.

The cutter I was on would typically be assigned a "bravo-6" condition
when in port.  This meant no one could be further away than would let
them get back to the ship, be at their duty station, and have all their
assigned areas ready to leave within 6 hours.  Usually this was within
3 hours of the base.

Alpha periods were almost always assigned to short-endurance boats.  The
readiness level depended on the weather and expected activity (they would
be expected to respond more quickly on say, memorial day, when there
was a lot of (drunk) people boating).  IF there were a storm warning, or
whatever, typical response time was from 30 seconds to 5 minutes.  The
longest "alpha" I ever heard of was 2 hours.

Charlie periods were typically time spent in the yard.  No one expected
the ship to get underway at all.  There was some fiction about being
able to get underway within two weeks.  Of course you can guess how
likely this is if you're in dry dock, with engines dismantled, part
of the hull removed, and half the ship's wiring stripped out.

Subject: taxes




A couple of thoughts tumble forth from my recolletions of days long ago:

1. A fellow High Passage writer once asked Marc Miller about
taxes once when we were at a convention. He wanted an idea of
how such a system would work and how to incorporate it into the
game if it would make a difference in some gaming situations.
Marc grimmaced, made various gurgling noises, sat silently for a
few seconds, and then finally suggested that we foget the whole
thing as it would be a lot of work to figure out such a system and
it would only add marginal things to the game. He stated that for
official purposes, we should consider taxes factored into the game
system.


2. Re: taxes and Trillion Credit Squadron: There is also a taxes
system in good old Striker, and the two are very, very different.
I remember computing a budget for a medium sized world using the
Striker system (or was it TCS?) and computing that the world would
be able to build and maintain several hundred Tigress class 500,000
ton dreadnoughts per year. This discovery was very humorous, as
we were designing the Old Expanses Fleet at the time. We figured
that using the official rules we could easily build a fleet that
could take the rest of the Imperium by force with no trouble.
Mr. Miller was not amused by the fact that the design rules made
this possible, and told us to more or les ignore the system.

1600 LIGHT-YEARS, DAMMIT! LIGHT-YEARS! NOT MILES! Jeesh....

And on Dan's argument that we could have black holes or neutron stars in
every sector, but we couldn't see them if they weren't companions of bright
astral bodies (like, say, Nina Hartley's |-> ), I'm afraid that that argument
falls apart at densities like those he suggests. The black holes about which
we know (or claim to know) are very far away from us, and can only be seen by
their Xray emissions, but if we had a black hole within our back yard (i.e.
within 25 parsecs, the radius of our sector, approx), we'd sure as hell know
it. Black holes cause vicious gravitational lensing; as they move across the
sky, they'd cause the light of stars that they occulted to move in response
to their gravity wells. If any sort of concerted effort were made to chart
star movements within a sector, it would take very little time (in historical
terms, that is) to spot the effects of a black hole in a sector; and at one-
per-subsector densities, things get even worse.

Subject: Dead Stars  (was black holes)
Date: Thu Oct 19 16:18:46 1989
From: richard@agora.hf.intel.COM (Richard Johnson)



I once had a player with a character who was a gravitic scientist
(which should help explain my obsession).  This gentleman went on a
research trip to a section of the galaxy where there were some
VERY old stars.

He found a "radio dwarf" with a black body temperature of about
400K (~30 degrees C) and *landed* on it.  He, in his zeal had
neglected the mass of this huge ball of iron and lead.  On the
surface, it pulled about 7 g.  His ship could pull 5.

With a great deal of difficulty moving about on board (2 g with
the grav plates maxed negative) he managed to start rolling along
the surface of the dead star.  By continuously accelerating along
the almost perfectly smooth surface, his pilot was able to put
their research ship into orbit.

Given a chance, I think there are many adventures we could make
out of these kinds of space "debris" we usually ignore.

Bart Massey has suggested I might have confused General Relativity
with quantum mechanical uncertainty in regards to the reason star
ships need to be in "smooth" space to jump.

Actually, I was trying to say that firmly locating both the position
AND the velocity of "gravitons" is an activity that produces
uncerrtainty in the macroscopic universe.

Of course this is all wild speculation anyway.

Subject: New Topic/Habitats



I was curious how many people run games in habitats and what they think of
the scenarios they use.  My game world relies on them a great deal because
I assume that once people learn to space-industrialize, they won't go
back.  Thus, the average population of a solar system in my game world
is about four hundred billion.  If people live on planets (terraformed
Earth-like ones, that is), which only happens in about one system in ten,
such a population is about one percent of the total population of the system.

Habitats in my world tend to be clustered around large asteroids (100 km. +)
or the giant moons of gas giants.  Why?  Lots of natural resources close by.
(A 100 km. asteroid has enough material in it to build hundreds or thousands
or habitats, even assuming a low metal/organic/other useful stuff-to-slag
ratio; giant moons give you even more, even if they're mostly ice there will
be organics to make plastics from, etc.)

My basic large habitat is a rotating cylinder 15 km. across the base and
60 km. long.  In addition to the landscaped interior, which I call a "dayside"
because it sounds like something people might call such a place, I assume
that the ends of the cylinder are solid complexes.  Actually, they're like
the ring-type space stations you see in 2001, only on a much bigger scale.
Assuming an average ceiling height of 10 m.--the idea is to make these things
non-claustrophobic since a lot of people live on some of the levels--you have
room for about 700 levels.  If the complexes are 100 m. wide the effect
is something like having 700 shopping malls (only most of them are offices,
neighborhoods with townhouses, etc.) stacked on top of each other, and the
two complexes give you about 3600 square km.  Add this to the 1200 square
km. you get from the dayside, and the habitat (which I assume as having a
population of roughly one million) has a total of nearly 5000 square km.
of surface area.  The dayside is used for farms, parks, etc., and the
endwall complexes have apartment levels, business levels, factories,
warehouses, etc.  This leaves us with a population density similar to
that of Great Britain or New England.  Plenty of room for everyone.
(After all, what's the point of technologically advanced if you have
to live packed together like rats in a barrel?)

Running these environments is not hard.  The endwall complexes are just
like city streets, except that they are a lot cleaner, there are no cars,
and the subways (stations every half-kilometer or so) are big elevators
that either stop at every level, every ten levels, or every hundred levels
(I think this is how they run elevators in large buildings like the Trade
Center; at any rate, I'm sure this is a problem anyone with a degree in
city planning could solve in about five minutes, although it might take
longer to work out all the details.)  The daysides are pretty much
outdoor environments, except you cannot use Field Artillery (people take
a VERY dim view of someone blowing a hole in the side of their world).
By the way, I assume the hulls of these things are several meters thick,
both for structural strength and radiation shielding, and about half of
that is good ol' topsoil, so you can have reasonably large trees in
these habitats, and hills (small ones), and lakes, and so on.

Well, I'll stop here...I could easily ramble on about these things for
much longer.  Anyone have any comments?  ideas?  suggestions?

I would suggest sculpting your dayside to provide for the hills and lakes.
That way you don't have large areas of wasted topsoil.  The soil is a
uniform thickness throughout and the elevation is provided by sculpting the
hull.

How about chaining habitats like a necklace when population pressures get
too large?  How long could a habitat run without supervision?  What about
"abandoned" structures?  Can they be moved, or can they only be created on
the spot?  If they can be moved is there a market in habitats orbiting
mined out asteroids?  Boy you could have a lot of adventures based on these
things:-)

Yes I agree, however I was not discussing changing the star generation process
(which I would have left on the star generation list), rather coming up
with a reason for the generation as listed. I did want a sub table to
generate other stellar phenomanon used perhaps once or twice per sector.
The rules (scouts) even mention adding supergiants in at a very low density
(1 per sector or so).

My main points are/were:
1) Stars not represented correctly (2D, too many non-dwarf, no black holes...)
a) Assume all stars are projected into a plane. to get 2D board
b) a large number of stars are not mapped (usualy dwarfs) because of no
bodies in the system for bases/fuel.
c) Resultant stars provide density and composition we get from the star
generation tables. (I have a good reason for 2D as well which I haven't
brought up).
d) Add in other interesting stellar objects at a rate of a few per sector
(I like a lot of black holes myself...but see first paragraph).
e) this results in no changes to the maps (execpt where you want to mark
other stellar objects), nor to any rules, it is just a method of
perceiving the traveller universe so that it approximates ours more closely
(after all we have already assumed a 2D universe)

2) Obervation techniques don't seem to match today's standards.
a) Correct me if I'm wrong as I havn't dug up my Zhodani alien module, but
I believe that in the core exploration rules, you only get to see an
area 2-3 parsecs ahead of you.
b) if you subscribe to (1) above, identifying good stars may that difficult.
c) if not, (I was probably exaggerating when I said we could see the entire
imperium from one location.) but even the near star map at 50 ly radius
represents a circle with a 30 parsec diameter, which is approximately a sector
(24x40 parsecs). That is with tech 8 ground based telescopes, a good TL 15
scout in space with no light noise sould get at least 4 sectors. (double range)
d) additionaly as an jump-capable observer can more easily calulate positions
by virtue of being able to observe from different points (from Leonard)

	-Dan

BTW I haven't received any mail (dan@engrg.uwo.ca) complaining, so I will
continue this discussion on the list.

>How long could a habitat run without supervision?

A quick guess would be that when they first starting to appear(technically
feasable)  I would say, that they need LOTS of supervision, while as they
are used more in the higher tech levels, they would need very little super
vision in themselves(like the Azun structures in JTAS #15 I think).  But
the supervision is more for security to keep sabotage to a minimium.  So
if noone sabotaged the structure or systems, a tech 15 Habitat I would
think, could conceivable run for years with no outside help.  Though it
would have to be designed from the start to be fairly self sustaining.

>What about "abandoned" structures?

I would say lots if you are using the shattered IMperium rules.  Afterall,
they can make very good targets.

>Can they be moved, or can they only be created on the spot?

The smaller ones probly can be moved by a ship similar to the bulk cargo
carrior in Fighting Ships.  Who knows, someone may have designed a ship
to do it.  Why, I don't know, it would be cheaper to take it apart and reuse
the parts elsewhere, transported by a smaller (and cheaper) ship.

>Boy you could have a lot of adventures based on these things:-)

A viably untaped resource for adventures.  You can have all sorts of
environments, Water, desert, ice, vaccume(why I don't know) and then
some.

Actually, at distances of parsecs, the light bending properties of black
holes are not significantly different from those of ordinary stars of the
same mass.  I won't bother you (unless provoked!) with the math, but the
point is that the Einstein ring diameter (=characteristic scale of lensing
phenomena) is far larger than the stellar radius so that it makes very
little difference whether the mass is concentrated within its
Schwarzschild radius or merely within a normal stellar radius.  The
differences get more impressive if you get close (say within about 0.01 pc).

On the general topic of stellar exotica in Traveller, one should not
overlook degenerate (white) dwarf stars which are certainly common enough
to appear in great numbers within the Imperium.  Although much less
exotic than neutron stars and black holes, their large surface gravities
and tendancy to produce enormous explosions (novae) when provided with a
bit of hydrogen fuel might allow for some interesting adventures.  BTW,
such stars often occur in binary systems which would allow for an
ordinary star supporting habitable planets in the near vicinity of a
degenerate dwarf.

Subject: Habitats



Regarding some of the questions on habitats...

Most of the habitats in my game world (I don't really rely on Tech Levels
all that much, except as a reference for when certain tech items show up;
everyone is pretty much at the same very high level of technology) can
run on their own for a while.  Eventually, the environment will break
down, but these things come with a series of very smart environmental
computers and a lot of tech robots to help the environmental engineers
keep things going.  If everyone suddenly died, the habitat would keep
running itself for a while.

As for moving them, why not?  If the habitat is using fusion and matter-
antimatter power, you won't disturb the power source by moving it (as you
might with a solar-based power system); if you boost the thing at a very
low degree of thrust and build it up slowly, you could eventually make
the thing an oversized spacecraft.  The internal gravity will not be
disturbed that much, even on rotating habitats, if the thrust from external
engines is only, say, 1/1000th of a gravity.  (or 1/10000th.)  Sure, it
will take years to get anywhere, but you have a habitat, so what's the hurry?

Abandoned habitats?  Not very many of them.  Habitats are very expensive;
even the raw materials used to build them are quite valuable.  If a habitat
has been somehow rendered uninhabitable (terrorists, plague, war, etc.) or
if it has simply broken down over time, and it takes time, I assume a high
technology habitat can probably last a million years or more if properly
maintained, the raw materials will quickly be recycled for something else.
Someone will claim it; people will probably fight over that much refined
material!  (Good source for adventures--salvage wars!)  The only place I
think you would find them would be underpopulated systems or the cometary
halo (i.e., isolated areas where there is not enough a population base to
handle the industrial problems involved in recycling that big a hulk.)

Well, go go now.  Take care.

Subject: The Horrors of Realistic Weapons



I have been trying for a long time to develop a realistic combat system
for Traveller.  As some of you may have figured out by now, the good people
at GDW often have some very good ideas, but just as often have no f**king
clue what they're doing.

In part, they're hampered by the basic problem of game design: the more
realistic you make a game, the less playable it is.  Even so, some of
what they have come up with for combat is either implausible or just
flat wrong.

I would be interested in hearing how the people on the mailing list have
reacted to the various combat systems created by GDW, and the modifications
they have come up with to deal with aspects they did not like.

For a start, I have had to develop my own damage system--based not on
statistics, for the most part, but on (a) location of hit on a person's
body and (b) the actual damage caused by the weapon.  In addition, I
think some weapons have been treated very poorly in terms of how effective
they are.  Many primitive weapons are much more dangerous (bows, especially)
than the GDW tables would have you think.

Disclaimer: I have not looked at the original GDW books in a while, so when
it comes to particulars, I have to cite from memory.  Please correct me
if I am wrong about any specific weapons, etc.  (I have a feeling that
for the most part, however, people will agree that GDW combat systems leave
something to be desired.)

I have a friend who uses a modified Azhanti High Lightning systeem, with
