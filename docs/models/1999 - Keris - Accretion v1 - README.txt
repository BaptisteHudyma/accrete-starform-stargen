A version by Andrew Folkins, based more closely on Dole's original paper (but more CPU intensive) and modified to ANSI(ish) C by me. I've hacked it
about, removing some of his optimisations (modern processors don't have any problem with the time it takes, it's well under a second now on any Pentium) to get
back nearer to the original. I've also added gas accretion for normal planets to give some sort of atmosphere, it seems to work reasonably. The output formats
are (of course) totally different from starform.
