tests the limits of dole's model

discusses correcting Accrete not accounting for the vertical dust density distribution when accreting dust

discusses varying the initial dust density distribution formula

examines the choices of orbital eccentricity for the dust cloud

talks about parallel growth and injection of plantismals

notes cost of time on the ibm mainframe in Cornell worked out to about $1 a solar system or 10 cents a planet

found that varying the planetismal seed mass by many orders of magnitude had no significant impact on results.

talks about altering the dust to gas mass ratio.

notes decreasing / increasing A scales the mass in the cloud

notes Accrete does not support binary+ systems

suggests Urey's vertical dust density distribution formula but concludes its difficult to add a vertical component and that model leaves out some pertinent
physics.

suggests a number of density distribution formula.
