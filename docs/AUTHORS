Authors of the Various Versions that I have looked at so far

ACRETE (original version)
Stephen H. Dole
    Author of the original computer simulation code/research paper that spawned all the various subsequent versions. Whilst I have not recovered his original
    source code; I have tried to recreate his original engine based on his papers that exist online.

Silicon Creation (aka Starform)
Martyn J. Fogg



ACCRETE

Ian Burrell - http://znark.com/create/accrete.html
	Ian Burrell's version, written in java, has provided the initial understanding of how accretion works.

Mat Burdick - http://znark.com/create/accrete.html, http://reocities.com/CapeCanaveral/8191/usmlarchive.html
 	Most widely used version of accrete and any improvements made by other authors will be easier to port over
 	because of this. Unfortunately I was unable to detect a site containing his latest up to date code, so
 	Ian Burrell's hosted unmodified copy will have to do.


STARFORM

Mat Burdick - http://znark.com/create/accrete.html, http://reocities.com/CapeCanaveral/8191/usmlarchive.html
 	Improved version of Accrete. Basis on which a lot of the later versions are built.

Carl Burke - http://www.reocities.com/Area51/6902/w_accr.html
	Another Java Applet, but with some visuals.


UNPROCESSED

Jon Leech - http://znark.com/create/accrete.html, http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/usr/mnr/st/std096
	Jon Leech wrote an alternative version, which I have included for the sake of completeness.


Andrew Folkins - http://reocities.com/CapeCanaveral/8191/usmlarchive.html
	Andrew Folkins at some point published his own version (for the amiga), which was then modified by keris, unfortunately it is packed up in a shar 
	which I not gotten around to the trouble of opening yet.

Chris "Keris" Croughton - DECEASED - http://www.firedrake.org/keris/
	Chris builds upon mat's version and this is used as the basis of StarGen and several other forks. His main contributions are 
	improving the code's structure, adding various atmosphere bits and bobs and improved star code. He has also build upon a
	version made by Andrew Folkins.
