Authors of Various Versions that I have looked at so far

Ian Burrell - http://znark.com/create/accrete.html
	Ian Burrell's version, written in java, has provided the initial understanding of how accretion works.

Jon Leech - http://znark.com/create/accrete.html, http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/usr/mnr/st/std096
	Jon Leech wrote an alternative version, which I have included for the sake of completeness.
	
Mat Burdick - http://znark.com/create/accrete.html, http://reocities.com/CapeCanaveral/8191/usmlarchive.html
 	This version is used as a basis for this port, as it is the most widely used and any improvements made by other authors will
 	be easier to port over because of this. Unfortunately I was unable to detect a site containing his latest up to date code, so
 	Ian Burrell's unmodified copy will have to do.

Andrew Folkins - http://reocities.com/CapeCanaveral/8191/usmlarchive.html
	Andrew Folkins at some point published his own version (for the amiga), which was then modified by keris, unfortunately it is packed up in a shar 
	which I am unable to open on windows.

Chris "Keris" Croughton - DECEASED - http://www.firedrake.org/keris/
	Chris builds upon mat's version and this is used as the basis of StarGen and several other forks. His main contributions are 
	improving the code's structure, adding various atmosphere bits and bobs and prototype moon code. He has also build upon a 
	version made by Andrew Folkins. TODO Further Investigate
	
Carl Burke - http://www.reocities.com/Area51/6902/w_accr.html
	Another Java Applet, but with better visuals. TODO Further Investigate
